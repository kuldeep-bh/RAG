    "I built a PDF-based Question-Answering system using Python, LangChain, Chroma, and Groq LLM. The system can read PDF documents, split them into manageable text chunks, convert the text into embeddings, and store them in a vector database for fast semantic search. When a question is asked, the system retrieves the most relevant chunks and uses a language model to generate accurate answers. This approach allows interactive, AI-powered exploration of documents, making it easy to get insights directly from PDFs."

    "**1. What is RAG?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a method in AI that combines retrieval-based search with generative AI.\n",
    "  - Instead of relying only on a language model’s memory, RAG retrieves relevant information from external sources (like documents, databases, or the web) before generating an answer.\n",
    "- This improves accuracy, reduces hallucinations, and allows handling large knowledge bases.\n",
    "  - In simple words:\n",
    "  - “RAG is when an AI first looks up relevant information and then uses that to answer questions.”\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Why RAG is used**\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is used to:\n",
    "  - Handle Large Knowledge\n",
    "  - LLMs have a token limit. RAG lets the model access information outside its memory.\n",
    "- Increase Accuracy\n",
    "  - The model can base answers on real data retrieved from documents or databases.\n",
    "  - Reduce Hallucination\n",
    "- Generative models sometimes make up facts. Retrieval helps anchor the answer in real information.\n",
    "  - Enable Domain-Specific Q&A\n",
    "  - Useful in enterprise settings, research, or PDFs where the content is specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Functions / Components of RAG**\n",
    "\n",
    "**RAG typically involves three main components:**\n",
    "**1.Retriever**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Finds relevant documents or information from a knowledge base.\n",
    "- How it works:\n",
    "  - Converts your query into a vector (embedding).\n",
    "  - Searches a database of document vectors (like FAISS, Chroma, or Pinecone) to find the closest matches.\n",
    "  - Example: If you ask, “What is RAG in AI?”, the retriever fetches documents explaining RAG.\n",
    "**2.Knowledge Base / Document Store**\n",
    "**Purpose**: Stores all the information the retriever can search through.\n",
    "- Types:\n",
    "  - Text files, PDFs, or web data.\n",
    "  - Embedding-based vector databases for fast similarity search.\n",
    "  - Example Tools: ChromaDB, Pinecone, FAISS.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.Generator**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Uses the retrieved documents to generate a final, coherent response.\n",
    "- How it works:\n",
    "  - Takes the retrieved documents as context.\n",
    "  - Generates natural language answers using models like GPT, LLaMA, or T5.\n",
    "  - Key: Ensures the answer is informative and contextually relevant, not just based on memorized knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. How RAG Works (Step by Step)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input Question\n",
    "  - User asks: “What is Python?”\n",
    "- Retrieval Step\n",
    "  - The retriever searches the vector database for relevant chunks from PDFs, docs, or knowledge bases.\n",
    "- Augmentation Step\n",
    "  - Retrieved documents are passed as context to the LLM.\n",
    "- Generation Step\n",
    "  - LLM generates an answer using both the context and its language knowledge.\n",
    "  - Output Answer\n",
    "  - Returns the answer along with optional source documents.\n",

It has eﬃcient high-level data structures and a simple but eﬀective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.\\n\\nThe Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.\\n\\nThe Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.\\n\\nThis tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read oﬀ-line as well.\\n\\nFor a description of standard objects and modules, see library-index. reference-index gives a more formal deﬁnition of the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read extending-index and c-api-index. There are also several books covering Python in depth.\\n\\nThis tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of Python’s most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the language’s ﬂavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and write Python modules and programs, and you will be ready to learn more about the various Python library modules described in library-index.\\n\\nThe Glossary is also worth going through.\\n\\nCONTENTS\\n\\n1\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n2\\n\\nCONTENTS\\n\\nCHAPTER\\n\\nONE\\n\\nWHETTING YOUR APPETITE\\n\\nIf you do much work on computers, eventually you ﬁnd that there’s some task you’d like to automate. For example, you may wish to perform a search-and-replace over a large number of text ﬁles, or rename and rearrange a bunch of photo ﬁles in a complicated way. Perhaps you’d like to write a small custom database, or a specialized GUI application, or a simple game.\\n\\nIf you’re a professional software developer, you may have to work with several C/C++/Java libraries but ﬁnd the usual write/compile/test/re-compile cycle is too slow. Perhaps you’re writing a test suite for such a library and ﬁnd writing the testing code a tedious task. Or maybe you’ve written a program that could use an extension language, and you don’t want to design and implement a whole new language for your application.\\n\\nPython is just the language for you.\\n\\nYou could write a Unix shell script or Windows batch ﬁles for some of these tasks, but shell scripts are best at moving around ﬁles and changing text data, not well-suited for GUI applications or games. You could write a C/C++/Java program, but it can take a lot of development time to get even a ﬁrst-draft program. Python is simpler to use, available on Windows, Mac OS X, and Unix operating systems, and will help you get the job done more quickly.\\n\\nPython is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, oﬀering much more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or batch ﬁles can oﬀer. On the other hand, Python also oﬀers much more error checking than C, and, being a very-high-level language, it has high-level data types built in, such as ﬂexible arrays and dictionaries. Because of its more general data types Python is applicable to a much larger problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least as easy in Python as in those languages.\\n\\nPython allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs. It comes with a large collection of standard modules that you can use as the basis of your programs — or as examples to start learning to program in Python. Some of these modules provide things like ﬁle I/O, system calls, sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits like Tk.\\n\\nPython is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary. The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it easy to experiment with features of the language, to write throw-away programs, or to test functions during bottom-up program development. It is also a handy desk calculator.\\n\\nPython enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:\\n\\nthe high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;\\n\\nstatement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;\\n\\nno variable or argument declarations are necessary.\\n\\nPython is extensible: if you know how to program in C it is easy to add a new built-in function or module to the interpreter, either to perform critical operations at maximum speed, or to link Python programs to libraries that may only be available in binary form (such as a vendor-speciﬁc graphics library). Once you\\n\\n3\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nare really hooked, you can link the Python interpreter into an application written in C and use it as an extension or command language for that application.\\n\\nBy the way, the language is named after the BBC show “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” and has nothing to do with reptiles. Making references to Monty Python skits in documentation is not only allowed, it is encouraged!\\n\\nNow that you are all excited about Python, you’ll want to examine it in some more detail. Since the best way to learn a language is to use it, the tutorial invites you to play with the Python interpreter as you read.\\n\\nIn the next chapter, the mechanics of using the interpreter are explained. This is rather mundane information, but essential for trying out the examples shown later.\\n\\nThe rest of the tutorial introduces various features of the Python language and system through examples, beginning with simple expressions, statements and data types, through functions and modules, and ﬁnally touching upon advanced concepts like exceptions and user-deﬁned classes.\\n\\n4\\n\\nChapter 1. Whetting Your Appetite\\n\\nCHAPTER\\n\\nTWO\\n\\nUSING THE PYTHON INTERPRETER\\n\\n2.1 Invoking the Interpreter\\n\\nThe Python interpreter is usually installed as /usr/local/bin/python3.7 on those machines where it is available; putting /usr/local/bin in your Unix shell’s search path makes it possible to start it by typing the command:\\n\\npython3.7\\n\\nto the shell.1 Since the choice of the directory where the interpreter lives is an installation option, other places are possible; check with your local Python guru or system administrator. (E.g., /usr/local/python is a popular alternative location.)\\n\\nOn Windows machines, the Python installation is usually placed in C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Python37\\\\, though you can change this when you’re running the installer. To add this directory to your path, you can type the following command into the command prompt in a DOS box:\\n\\nset path=%path%;C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Python37\\\\\\n\\nTyping an end-of-ﬁle character (Control-D on Unix, Control-Z on Windows) at the primary prompt causes the interpreter to exit with a zero exit status. If that doesn’t work, you can exit the interpreter by typing the following command: quit().\\n\\nThe interpreter’s line-editing features include interactive editing, history substitution and code completion on systems that support readline. Perhaps the quickest check to see whether command line editing is supported is typing Control-P to the ﬁrst Python prompt you get. If it beeps, you have command line editing; see Appendix Interactive Input Editing and History Substitution for an introduction to the keys. If nothing appears to happen, or if ^P is echoed, command line editing isn’t available; you’ll only be able to use backspace to remove characters from the current line.\\n\\nThe interpreter operates somewhat like the Unix shell: when called with standard input connected to a tty device, it reads and executes commands interactively; when called with a ﬁle name argument or with a ﬁle as standard input, it reads and executes a script from that ﬁle.\\n\\nA second way of starting the interpreter is python -c command [arg] ..., which executes the statement(s) in command, analogous to the shell’s -c option. Since Python statements often contain spaces or other characters that are special to the shell, it is usually advised to quote command in its entirety with single quotes.\\n\\nSome Python modules are also useful as scripts. These can be invoked using python -m module [arg] ..., which executes the source ﬁle for module as if you had spelled out its full name on the command line.\\n\\nWhen a script ﬁle is used, it is sometimes useful to be able to run the script and enter interactive mode afterwards. This can be done by passing -i before the script.\\n\\n1 On Unix, the Python 3.x interpreter is by default not installed with the executable named python, so that it does not\\n\\nconﬂict with a simultaneously installed Python 2.x executable.\\n\\n5\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nAll command line options are described in using-on-general.\\n\\n2.1.1 Argument Passing\\n\\nWhen known to the interpreter, the script name and additional arguments thereafter are turned into a list of strings and assigned to the argv variable in the sys module. You can access this list by executing import sys. The length of the list is at least one; when no script and no arguments are given, sys.argv[0] is an empty string. When the script name is given as \\'-\\' (meaning standard input), sys.argv[0] is set to \\'-\\'. When -c command is used, sys.argv[0] is set to \\'-c\\'. When -m module is used, sys.argv[0] is set to the full name of the located module. Options found after -c command or -m module are not consumed by the Python interpreter’s option processing but left in sys.argv for the command or module to handle.\\n\\n2.1.2 Interactive Mode\\n\\nWhen commands are read from a tty, the interpreter is said to be in interactive mode. In this mode it prompts for the next command with the primary prompt, usually three greater-than signs (>>>); for continuation lines it prompts with the secondary prompt, by default three dots (...). The interpreter prints a welcome message stating its version number and a copyright notice before printing the ﬁrst prompt:\\n\\n$ python3.7 Python 3.7 (default, Sep 16 2015, 09:25:04) [GCC 4.8.2] on linux Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information. >>>\\n\\nContinuation lines are needed when entering a multi-line construct. As an example, take a look at this if statement:\\n\\n>>> the_world_is_flat = True >>> if the_world_is_flat: ... ... Be careful not to fall off!\\n\\nprint(\"Be careful not to fall off!\")\\n\\nFor more on interactive mode, see Interactive Mode.\\n\\n2.2 The Interpreter and Its Environment\\n\\n2.2.1 Source Code Encoding\\n\\nIn that encoding, characters of most By default, Python source ﬁles are treated as encoded in UTF-8. languages in the world can be used simultaneously in string literals, identiﬁers and comments — although the standard library only uses ASCII characters for identiﬁers, a convention that any portable code should follow. To display all these characters properly, your editor must recognize that the ﬁle is UTF-8, and it must use a font that supports all the characters in the ﬁle.\\n\\nTo declare an encoding other than the default one, a special comment line should be added as the ﬁrst line of the ﬁle. The syntax is as follows:\\n\\n# -*- coding: encoding -*-\\n\\nwhere encoding is one of the valid codecs supported by Python.\\n\\n6\\n\\nChapter 2. Using the Python Interpreter\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nFor example, to declare that Windows-1252 encoding is to be used, the ﬁrst line of your source code ﬁle should be:\\n\\n# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-\\n\\nOne exception to the ﬁrst line rule is when the source code starts with a UNIX “shebang” line. In this case, the encoding declaration should be added as the second line of the ﬁle. For example:\\n\\n#!/usr/bin/env python3 # -*- coding: cp1252 -*-\\n\\n2.2. The Interpreter and Its Environment\\n\\n7\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n8\\n\\nChapter 2. Using the Python Interpreter\\n\\nCHAPTER\\n\\nTHREE\\n\\nAN INFORMAL INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON\\n\\nIn the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the presence or absence of prompts (>>> and …): to repeat the example, you must type everything after the prompt, when the prompt appears; lines that do not begin with a prompt are output from the interpreter. Note that a secondary prompt on a line by itself in an example means you must type a blank line; this is used to end a multi-line command.\\n\\nMany of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the interactive prompt, include comments. Comments in Python start with the hash character, #, and extend to the end of the physical line. A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character. Since comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted by Python, they may be omitted when typing in examples.\\n\\nSome examples:\\n\\n# this is the first comment spam = 1 # and this is the second comment # ... and now a third!\\n\\ntext = \"# This is not a comment because it\\'s inside quotes.\"\\n\\n3.1 Using Python as a Calculator\\n\\nLet’s try some simple Python commands. Start the interpreter and wait for the primary prompt, >>>. (It shouldn’t take long.)\\n\\n3.1.1 Numbers\\n\\nThe interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax is straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work just like in most other languages (for example, Pascal or C); parentheses (()) can be used for grouping. For example:\\n\\n>>> 2 + 2 4 >>> 50 - 5*6 20 >>> (50 - 5*6) / 4 5.0 >>> 8 / 5 # division always returns a floating point number 1.6\\n\\nThe integer numbers (e.g. 2, 4, 20) have type int, the ones with a fractional part (e.g. 5.0, 1.6) have type float. We will see more about numeric types later in the tutorial.\\n\\n9\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nDivision (/) always returns a ﬂoat. To do ﬂoor division and get an integer result (discarding any fractional result) you can use the // operator; to calculate the remainder you can use %:\\n\\n>>> 17 / 3 # classic division returns a float 5.666666666666667 >>> >>> 17 // 3 5 >>> 17 % 3 # the % operator returns the remainder of the division 2 >>> 5 * 3 + 2 # result * divisor + remainder 17\\n\\n# floor division discards the fractional part\\n\\nWith Python, it is possible to use the ** operator to calculate powers1:\\n\\n>>> 5 ** 2 # 5 squared 25 >>> 2 ** 7 # 2 to the power of 7 128\\n\\nThe equal sign (=) is used to assign a value to a variable. Afterwards, no result is displayed before the next interactive prompt:\\n\\n>>> width = 20 >>> height = 5 * 9 >>> width * height 900\\n\\nIf a variable is not “deﬁned” (assigned a value), trying to use it will give you an error:\\n\\n>>> n # try to access an undefined variable Traceback (most recent call last):\\n\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\n\\nNameError: name \\'n\\' is not defined\\n\\nThere is full support for ﬂoating point; operators with mixed type operands convert the integer operand to ﬂoating point:\\n\\n>>> 4 * 3.75 - 1 14.0\\n\\nIn interactive mode, the last printed expression is assigned to the variable _. This means that when you are using Python as a desk calculator, it is somewhat easier to continue calculations, for example:\\n\\n>>> tax = 12.5 / 100 >>> price = 100.50 >>> price * tax 12.5625 >>> price + _ 113.0625 >>> round(_, 2) 113.06\\n\\nThis variable should be treated as read-only by the user. Don’t explicitly assign a value to it — you would create an independent local variable with the same name masking the built-in variable with its magic behavior.\\n\\n1 Since ** has higher precedence than -, -3**2 will be interpreted as -(3**2) and thus result in -9. To avoid this and get\\n\\n9, you can use (-3)**2.\\n\\n10\\n\\nChapter 3. An Informal Introduction to Python\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nIn addition to int and float, Python supports other types of numbers, such as Decimal and Fraction. Python also has built-in support for complex numbers, and uses the j or J suﬃx to indicate the imaginary part (e.g. 3+5j).\\n\\n3.1.2 Strings\\n\\nBesides numbers, Python can also manipulate strings, which can be expressed in several ways. They can be enclosed in single quotes (\\'...\\') or double quotes (\"...\") with the same result2. \\\\ can be used to escape quotes:\\n\\n>>> \\'spam eggs\\' # single quotes \\'spam eggs\\' >>> \\'doesn\\\\\\'t\\' # use \\\\\\' to escape the single quote... \"doesn\\'t\" >>> \"doesn\\'t\" # ...or use double quotes instead \"doesn\\'t\" >>> \\'\"Yes,\" they said.\\' \\'\"Yes,\" they said.\\' >>> \"\\\\\"Yes,\\\\\" they said.\" \\'\"Yes,\" they said.\\' >>> \\'\"Isn\\\\\\'t,\" they said.\\' \\'\"Isn\\\\\\'t,\" they said.\\'\\n\\nIn the interactive interpreter, the output string is enclosed in quotes and special characters are escaped with backslashes. While this might sometimes look diﬀerent from the input (the enclosing quotes could change), the two strings are equivalent. The string is enclosed in double quotes if the string contains a single quote and no double quotes, otherwise it is enclosed in single quotes. The print() function produces a more readable output, by omitting the enclosing quotes and by printing escaped and special characters:\\n\\n>>> \\'\"Isn\\\\\\'t,\" they said.\\' \\'\"Isn\\\\\\'t,\" they said.\\' >>> print(\\'\"Isn\\\\\\'t,\" they said.\\') \"Isn\\'t,\" they said. >>> s = \\'First line.\\\\nSecond line.\\' # \\\\n means newline >>> s # without print(), \\\\n is included in the output \\'First line.\\\\nSecond line.\\' >>> print(s) # with print(), \\\\n produces a new line First line. Second line.\\n\\nIf you don’t want characters prefaced by \\\\ to be interpreted as special characters, you can use raw strings by adding an r before the ﬁrst quote:\\n\\n>>> print(\\'C:\\\\some\\\\name\\') # here \\\\n means newline! C:\\\\some ame >>> print(r\\'C:\\\\some\\\\name\\') C:\\\\some\\\\name\\n\\n# note the r before the quote\\n\\nString literals can span multiple lines. One way is using triple-quotes: \"\"\"...\"\"\" or \\'\\'\\'...\\'\\'\\'. End of lines are automatically included in the string, but it’s possible to prevent this by adding a \\\\ at the end of the line. The following example:\\n\\n2 Unlike other languages, special characters such as \\\\n have the same meaning with both single (\\'...\\') and double (\"...\") quotes. The only diﬀerence between the two is that within single quotes you don’t need to escape \" (but you have to escape \\\\\\') and vice versa.\\n\\n3.1.

There is no separate character type; a character is simply a string of size one:\\n\\n>>> word = \\'Python\\' >>> word[0] \\'P\\' >>> word[5] \\'n\\'\\n\\n# character in position 0\\n\\n# character in position 5\\n\\nIndices may also be negative numbers, to start counting from the right:\\n\\n12\\n\\nChapter 3. An Informal Introduction to Python\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n>>> word[-1] # last character \\'n\\' >>> word[-2] # second-last character \\'o\\' >>> word[-6] \\'P\\'\\n\\nNote that since -0 is the same as 0, negative indices start from -1.\\n\\nIn addition to indexing, slicing is also supported. While indexing is used to obtain individual characters, slicing allows you to obtain substring:\\n\\n>>> word[0:2] # characters from position 0 (included) to 2 (excluded) \\'Py\\' >>> word[2:5] # characters from position 2 (included) to 5 (excluded) \\'tho\\'\\n\\nNote how the start is always included, and the end always excluded. This makes sure that s[:i] + s[i:] is always equal to s:\\n\\n>>> word[:2] + word[2:] \\'Python\\' >>> word[:4] + word[4:] \\'Python\\'\\n\\nSlice indices have useful defaults; an omitted ﬁrst index defaults to zero, an omitted second index defaults to the size of the string being sliced.\\n\\n>>> word[:2] \\'Py\\' >>> word[4:] \\'on\\' >>> word[-2:] \\'on\\'\\n\\n# character from the beginning to position 2 (excluded)\\n\\n# characters from position 4 (included) to the end\\n\\n# characters from the second-last (included) to the end\\n\\nOne way to remember how slices work is to think of the indices as pointing between characters, with the left edge of the ﬁrst character numbered 0. Then the right edge of the last character of a string of n characters has index n, for example:\\n\\n+---+---+---+---+---+---+ | P | y | t | h | o | n | +---+---+---+---+---+---+ 6 3 0\\n\\n5 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n4\\n\\nThe ﬁrst row of numbers gives the position of the indices 0…6 in the string; the second row gives the corresponding negative indices. The slice from i to j consists of all characters between the edges labeled i and j, respectively.\\n\\nFor non-negative indices, the length of a slice is the diﬀerence of the indices, if both are within bounds. For example, the length of word[1:3] is 2.\\n\\nAttempting to use an index that is too large will result in an error:\\n\\n>>> word[42] # the word only has 6 characters Traceback (most recent call last):\\n\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module> IndexError: string index out of range\\n\\n3.1. Using Python as a Calculator\\n\\n13\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nHowever, out of range slice indexes are handled gracefully when used for slicing:\\n\\n>>> word[4:42] \\'on\\' >>> word[42:] \\'\\'\\n\\nPython strings cannot be changed — they are immutable. Therefore, assigning to an indexed position in the string results in an error:\\n\\n>>> word[0] = \\'J\\'\\n\\n...\\n\\nTypeError: \\'str\\' object does not support item assignment >>> word[2:] = \\'py\\'\\n\\n...\\n\\nTypeError: \\'str\\' object does not support item assignment\\n\\nIf you need a diﬀerent string, you should create a new one:\\n\\n>>> \\'J\\' + word[1:] \\'Jython\\' >>> word[:2] + \\'py\\' \\'Pypy\\'\\n\\nThe built-in function len() returns the length of a string:\\n\\n>>> s = \\'supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\\' >>> len(s) 34\\n\\nSee also:\\n\\ntextseq Strings are examples of sequence types, and support the common operations supported by such\\n\\ntypes.\\n\\nstring-methods Strings support a large number of methods for basic transformations and searching.\\n\\nf-strings String literals that have embedded expressions.\\n\\nformatstrings Information about string formatting with str.format().\\n\\nold-string-formatting The old formatting operations invoked when strings are the left operand of the %\\n\\noperator are described in more detail here.\\n\\n3.1.3 Lists\\n\\nPython knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. The most versatile is the list, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Lists might contain items of diﬀerent types, but usually the items all have the same type.\\n\\n>>> squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] >>> squares [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\\n\\nLike strings (and all other built-in sequence type), lists can be indexed and sliced:\\n\\n>>> squares[0] # indexing returns the item 1 >>> squares[-1]\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n14\\n\\nChapter 3. An Informal Introduction to Python\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n(continued from previous page)\\n\\n25 >>> squares[-3:] [9, 16, 25]\\n\\n# slicing returns a new list\\n\\nAll slice operations return a new list containing the requested elements. This means that the following slice returns a new (shallow) copy of the list:\\n\\n>>> squares[:] [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\\n\\nLists also support operations like concatenation:\\n\\n>>> squares + [36, 49, 64, 81, 100] [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]\\n\\nUnlike strings, which are immutable, lists are a mutable type, i.e. it is possible to change their content:\\n\\n>>> cubes = [1, 8, 27, 65, 125] # something\\'s wrong here >>> 4 ** 3 # the cube of 4 is 64, not 65! 64 >>> cubes[3] = 64 >>> cubes [1, 8, 27, 64, 125]\\n\\n# replace the wrong value\\n\\nYou can also add new items at the end of the list, by using the append() method (we will see more about methods later):\\n\\n>>> cubes.append(216) # add the cube of 6 >>> cubes.append(7 ** 3) # and the cube of 7 >>> cubes [1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343]\\n\\nAssignment to slices is also possible, and this can even change the size of the list or clear it entirely:\\n\\n>>> letters = [\\'a\\', \\'b\\', \\'c\\', \\'d\\', \\'e\\', \\'f\\', \\'g\\'] >>> letters [\\'a\\', \\'b\\', \\'c\\', \\'d\\', \\'e\\', \\'f\\', \\'g\\'] >>> # replace some values >>> letters[2:5] = [\\'C\\', \\'D\\', \\'E\\'] >>> letters [\\'a\\', \\'b\\', \\'C\\', \\'D\\', \\'E\\', \\'f\\', \\'g\\'] >>> # now remove them >>> letters[2:5] = [] >>> letters [\\'a\\', \\'b\\', \\'f\\', \\'g\\'] >>> # clear the list by replacing all the elements with an empty list >>> letters[:] = [] >>> letters []\\n\\nThe built-in function len() also applies to lists:\\n\\n>>> letters = [\\'a\\', \\'b\\', \\'c\\', \\'d\\'] >>> len(letters) 4\\n\\nIt is possible to nest lists (create lists containing other lists), for example:\\n\\n3.1. Using Python as a Calculator\\n\\n15\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n>>> a = [\\'a\\', \\'b\\', \\'c\\'] >>> n = [1, 2, 3] >>> x = [a, n] >>> x [[\\'a\\', \\'b\\', \\'c\\'], [1, 2, 3]] >>> x[0] [\\'a\\', \\'b\\', \\'c\\'] >>> x[0][1] \\'b\\'\\n\\n3.2 First Steps Towards Programming\\n\\nOf course, we can use Python for more complicated tasks than adding two and two together. For instance, we can write an initial sub-sequence of the Fibonacci series as follows:\\n\\n>>> # Fibonacci series: ... # the sum of two elements defines the next ... a, b = 0, 1 >>> while a < 10: ... ... ... 0 1 1 2 3 5 8\\n\\nprint(a) a, b = b, a+b\\n\\nThis example introduces several new features.\\n\\nThe ﬁrst line contains a multiple assignment: the variables a and b simultaneously get the new values 0 and 1. On the last line this is used again, demonstrating that the expressions on the right-hand side are all evaluated ﬁrst before any of the assignments take place. The right-hand side expressions are evaluated from the left to the right.\\n\\nThe while loop executes as long as the condition (here: a < 10) remains true. In Python, like in C, any non-zero integer value is true; zero is false. The condition may also be a string or list value, in fact any sequence; anything with a non-zero length is true, empty sequences are false. The test used in the example is a simple comparison. The standard comparison operators are written the same as in C: < (less than), > (greater than), == (equal to), <= (less than or equal to), >= (greater than or equal to) and != (not equal to).\\n\\nThe body of the loop is indented: indentation is Python’s way of grouping statements. At the interactive prompt, you have to type a tab or space(s) for each indented line. In practice you will prepare more complicated input for Python with a text editor; all decent text editors have an auto-indent facility. When a compound statement is entered interactively, it must be followed by a blank line to indicate completion (since the parser cannot guess when you have typed the last line). Note that each line within a basic block must be indented by the same amount.\\n\\nThe print() function writes the value of the argument(s) it is given.\\n\\nIt diﬀers from just writing the expression you want to write (as we did earlier in the calculator examples) in the way it handles multiple arguments, ﬂoating point quantities, and strings. Strings are printed without quotes, and a space is inserted between items, so you can format things nicely, like this:\\n\\n16\\n\\nChapter 3. An Informal Introduction to Python\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n>>> i = 256*256 >>> print(\\'The value of i is\\', i) The value of i is 65536\\n\\nThe keyword argument end can be used to avoid the newline after the output, or end the output with a diﬀerent string:\\n\\n>>> a, b = 0, 1 >>> while a < 1000: ... ... ... 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,\\n\\nprint(a, end=\\',\\') a, b = b, a+b\\n\\n3.2. First Steps Towards Programming\\n\\n17\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n18\\n\\nChapter 3. An Informal Introduction to Python\\n\\nCHAPTER\\n\\nFOUR\\n\\nMORE CONTROL FLOW TOOLS\\n\\nBesides the while statement just introduced, Python knows the usual control ﬂow statements known from other languages, with some twists.\\n\\n4.1 if Statements\\n\\nPerhaps the most well-known statement type is the if statement. For example:\\n\\n>>> x = int(input(\"Please enter an integer: \")) Please enter an integer: 42 >>> if x < 0: ... x = 0 ... print(\\'Negative changed to zero\\') ... elif x == 0: ... ... elif x == 1: ... ... else: ... ... More\\n\\nprint(\\'Zero\\')\\n\\nprint(\\'Single\\')\\n\\nprint(\\'More\\')\\n\\nThere can be zero or more elif parts, and the else part is optional. The keyword ‘elif’ is short for ‘else if’, and is useful to avoid excessive indentation. An if … elif … elif … sequence is a substitute for the switch or case statements found in other languages.\\n\\n4.2 for Statements\\n\\nThe for statement in Python diﬀers a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability to deﬁne both the iteration step and halting condition (as C), Python’s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence. For example (no pun intended):\\n\\n>>> # Measure some strings: ... words = [\\'cat\\', \\'window\\', \\'defenestrate\\'] >>> for w in words: ... ... cat 3 window 6 defenestrate 12\\n\\nprint(w, len(w))\\n\\n19\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nIf you need to modify the sequence you are iterating over while inside the loop (for example to duplicate selected items), it is recommended that you ﬁrst make a copy. Iterating over a sequence does not implicitly make a copy. The slice notation makes this especially convenient:\\n\\n>>> for w in words[:]: if len(w) > 6: ... ... ... >>> words [\\'defenestrate\\', \\'cat\\', \\'window\\', \\'defenestrate\\']\\n\\n# Loop over a slice copy of the entire list.\\n\\nwords.insert(0, w)\\n\\nWith for w in words:, the example would attempt to create an inﬁnite list, inserting defenestrate over and over again.\\n\\n4.3 The range() Function\\n\\nIf you do need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in function range() comes in handy. generates arithmetic progressions:\\n\\n>>> for i in range(5): ... ... 0 1 2 3 4\\n\\nprint(i)\\n\\nThe given end point is never part of the generated sequence; range(10) generates 10 values, the legal indices for items of a sequence of length 10. It is possible to let the range start at another number, or to specify a diﬀerent increment (even negative; sometimes this is called the ‘step’):\\n\\nrange(5, 10)\\n\\n5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\n\\nrange(0, 10, 3) 0, 3, 6, 9\\n\\nrange(-10, -100, -30)\\n\\n10, -40, -70\\n\\nTo iterate over the indices of a sequence, you can combine range() and len() as follows:\\n\\n>>> a = [\\'Mary\\', \\'had\\', \\'a\\', \\'little\\', \\'lamb\\'] >>> for i in range(len(a)): ... ... 0 Mary 1 had 2 a 3 little 4 lamb\\n\\nprint(i, a[i])\\n\\nIn most such cases, however, it is convenient to use the enumerate() function, see Looping Techniques.\\n\\nA strange thing happens if you just print a range:\\n\\n20\\n\\nChapter 4. More Control Flow Tools\\n\\nIt\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n>>> print(range(10)) range(0, 10)\\n\\nIn many ways the object returned by range() behaves as if it is a list, but in fact it isn’t. It is an object which returns the successive items of the desired sequence when you iterate over it, but it doesn’t really make the list, thus saving space.\\n\\nWe say such an object is iterable, that is, suitable as a target for functions and constructs that expect something from which they can obtain successive items until the supply is exhausted. We have seen that the for statement is such an iterator. The function list() is another; it creates lists from iterables:\\n\\n>>> list(range(5)) [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\\n\\nLater we will see more functions that return iterables and take iterables as argument.\\n\\n4.4 break and continue Statements, and else Clauses on Loops\\n\\nThe break statement, like in C, breaks out of the innermost enclosing for or while loop.\\n\\nLoop statements may have an else clause; it is executed when the loop terminates through exhaustion of the list (with for) or when the condition becomes false (with while), but not when the loop is terminated by a break statement. This is exempliﬁed by the following loop, which searches for prime numbers:\\n\\n>>> for n in range(2, 10): ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 2 is a prime number 3 is a prime number 4 equals 2 * 2 5 is a prime number 6 equals 2 * 3 7 is a prime number 8 equals 2 * 4 9 equals 3 * 3\\n\\nfor x in range(2, n): if n % x == 0:\\n\\nprint(n, \\'equals\\', x, \\'*\\', n//x) break\\n\\nelse:\\n\\n# loop fell through without finding a factor print(n, \\'is a prime number\\')\\n\\n(Yes, this is the correct code. Look closely: the else clause belongs to the for loop, not the if statement.)\\n\\nWhen used with a loop, the else clause has more in common with the else clause of a try statement than it does that of if statements: a try statement’s else clause runs when no exception occurs, and a loop’s else clause runs when no break occurs. For more on the try statement and exceptions, see Handling Exceptions.\\n\\nThe continue statement, also borrowed from C, continues with the next iteration of the loop:\\n\\n>>> for num in range(2, 10): ... ... ... ... Found an even number 2\\n\\nif num % 2 == 0:\\n\\nprint(\"Found an even number\", num) continue\\n\\nprint(\"Found a number\", num)\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n4.4. break and continue Statements, and else Clauses on Loops\\n\\n21\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n(continued from previous page)\\n\\nFound a number 3 Found an even number 4 Found a number 5 Found an even number 6 Found a number 7 Found an even number 8 Found a number 9\\n\\n4.5 pass Statements\\n\\nThe pass statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is required syntactically but the program requires no action. For example:\\n\\n>>> while True: ... ...\\n\\npass # Busy-wait for keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C)\\n\\nThis is commonly used for creating minimal classes:\\n\\n>>> class MyEmptyClass: ... ...\\n\\npass\\n\\nAnother place pass can be used is as a place-holder for a function or conditional body when you are working on new code, allowing you to keep thinking at a more abstract level. The pass is silently ignored:\\n\\n>>> def initlog(*args): ... ...\\n\\npass\\n\\n# Remember to implement this!\\n\\n4.6 Deﬁning Functions\\n\\nWe can create a function that writes the Fibonacci series to an arbitrary boundary:\\n\\n>>> def fib(n): ... ... ... ... ... ... ... >>> # Now call the function we just defined: ... fib(2000) 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597\\n\\n# write Fibonacci series up to n\\n\\n\"\"\"Print a Fibonacci series up to n.\"\"\" a, b = 0, 1 while a < n:\\n\\nprint(a, end=\\' \\') a, b = b, a+b\\n\\nprint()\\n\\nThe keyword def introduces a function deﬁnition. It must be followed by the function name and the parenthesized list of formal parameters. The statements that form the body of the function start at the next line, and must be indented.\\n\\nThe ﬁrst statement of the function body can optionally be a string literal; this string literal is the function’s (More about docstrings can be found in the section Documentation documentation string, or docstring.\\n\\n22\\n\\nChapter 4. More Control Flow Tools\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nStrings.) There are tools which use docstrings to automatically produce online or printed documentation, or to let the user interactively browse through code; it’s good practice to include docstrings in code that you write, so make a habit of it.\\n\\nThe execution of a function introduces a new symbol table used for the local variables of the function. More precisely, all variable assignments in a function store the value in the local symbol table; whereas variable references ﬁrst look in the local symbol table, then in the local symbol tables of enclosing functions, then in the global symbol table, and ﬁnally in the table of built-in names. Thus, global variables cannot be directly assigned a value within a function (unless named in a global statement), although they may be referenced.\\n\\nThe actual parameters (arguments) to a function call are introduced in the local symbol table of the called function when it is called; thus, arguments are passed using call by value (where the value is always an object reference, not the value of the object).1 When a function calls another function, a new local symbol table is created for that call.\\n\\nA function deﬁnition introduces the function name in the current symbol table. The value of the function name has a type that is recognized by the interpreter as a user-deﬁned function. This value can be assigned to another name which can then also be used as a function. This serves as a general renaming mechanism:\\n\\n>>> fib <function fib at 10042ed0> >>> f = fib >>> f(100) 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89\\n\\nComing from other languages, you might object that fib is not a function but a procedure since it doesn’t return a value. In fact, even functions without a return statement do return a value, albeit a rather boring one. This value is called None (it’s a built-in name). Writing the value None is normally suppressed by the interpreter if it would be the only value written. You can see it if you really want to using print():\\n\\n>>> fib(0) >>> print(fib(0)) None\\n\\nIt is simple to write a function that returns a list of the numbers of the Fibonacci series, instead of printing it:\\n\\n>>> def fib2(n): # return Fibonacci series up to n ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... >>> f100 = fib2(100) >>> f100 [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]\\n\\n\"\"\"Return a list containing the Fibonacci series up to n.\"\"\" result = [] a, b = 0, 1 while a < n:\\n\\nresult.append(a) a, b = b, a+b\\n\\n# see below\\n\\nreturn result\\n\\n# call it # write the result\\n\\nThis example, as usual, demonstrates some new Python features:\\n\\nThe return statement returns with a value from a function. return without an expression argument returns None. Falling oﬀ the end of a function also returns None.\\n\\nThe statement result.append(a) calls a method of the list object result. A method is a function that ‘belongs’ to an object and is named obj.methodname, where obj is some object (this may be an\\n\\n1 Actually, call by object reference would be a better description, since if a mutable object is passed, the caller will see any\\n\\nchanges the callee makes to it (items inserted into a list).\\n\\n4.6. Deﬁning Functions\\n\\n23\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nexpression), and methodname is the name of a method that is deﬁned by the object’s type. Diﬀerent types deﬁne diﬀerent methods. Methods of diﬀerent types may have the same name without causing ambiguity. (It is possible to deﬁne your own object types and methods, using classes, see Classes) The method append() shown in the example is deﬁned for list objects; it adds a new element at the end of the list. In this example it is equivalent to result = result + [a], but more eﬃcient.\\n\\n4.7 More on Deﬁning Functions\\n\\nIt is also possible to deﬁne functions with a variable number of arguments. There are three forms, which can be combined.\\n\\n4.7.1 Default Argument Values\\n\\nThe most useful form is to specify a default value for one or more arguments. This creates a function that can be called with fewer arguments than it is deﬁned to allow. For example:\\n\\ndef ask_ok(prompt, retries=4, reminder=\\'Please try again!\\'):\\n\\nwhile True:\\n\\nok = input(prompt) if ok in (\\'y\\', \\'ye\\', \\'yes\\'):\\n\\nreturn True\\n\\nif ok in (\\'n\\', \\'no\\', \\'nop\\', \\'nope\\'):\\n\\nreturn False retries = retries - 1 if retries < 0:\\n\\nraise ValueError(\\'invalid user response\\')\\n\\nprint(reminder)\\n\\nThis function can be called in several ways:\\n\\ngiving only the mandatory argument: ask_ok(\\'Do you really want to quit?\\')\\n\\ngiving one of the optional arguments: ask_ok(\\'OK to overwrite the file?\\', 2)\\n\\nor even giving all arguments: ask_ok(\\'OK to overwrite the file?\\', 2, \\'Come on, only yes or no!\\')\\n\\nThis example also introduces the in keyword. This tests whether or not a sequence contains a certain value.\\n\\nThe default values are evaluated at the point of function deﬁnition in the deﬁning scope, so that\\n\\ni = 5\\n\\ndef f(arg=i):\\n\\nprint(arg)\\n\\ni = 6 f()\\n\\nwill print 5.\\n\\nImportant warning: The default value is evaluated only once. This makes a diﬀerence when the default is a mutable object such as a list, dictionary, or instances of most classes. For example, the following function accumulates the arguments passed to it on subsequent calls:\\n\\n24\\n\\nChapter 4.

For instance, the following function:\\n\\ndef parrot(voltage, state=\\'a stiff\\', action=\\'voom\\', type=\\'Norwegian Blue\\'):\\n\\nprint(\"-- This parrot wouldn\\'t\", action, end=\\' \\') print(\"if you put\", voltage, \"volts through it.\") print(\"-- Lovely plumage, the\", type) print(\"-- It\\'s\", state, \"!\")\\n\\naccepts one required argument (voltage) and three optional arguments (state, action, and type). This function can be called in any of the following ways:\\n\\nparrot(1000) parrot(voltage=1000) parrot(voltage=1000000, action=\\'VOOOOOM\\') parrot(action=\\'VOOOOOM\\', voltage=1000000) parrot(\\'a million\\', \\'bereft of life\\', \\'jump\\') parrot(\\'a thousand\\', state=\\'pushing up the daisies\\')\\n\\n# 1 positional argument # 1 keyword argument # 2 keyword arguments # 2 keyword arguments # 3 positional arguments # 1 positional, 1 keyword\\n\\nbut all the following calls would be invalid:\\n\\nparrot() parrot(voltage=5.0, \\'dead\\') # non-keyword argument after a keyword argument parrot(110, voltage=220) parrot(actor=\\'John Cleese\\') # unknown keyword argument\\n\\n# required argument missing\\n\\n# duplicate value for the same argument\\n\\nIn a function call, keyword arguments must follow positional arguments. All the keyword arguments passed must match one of the arguments accepted by the function (e.g. actor is not a valid argument for the parrot function), and their order is not important. This also includes non-optional arguments (e.g. parrot(voltage=1000) is valid too). No argument may receive a value more than once. Here’s an example that fails due to this restriction:\\n\\n4.7. More on Deﬁning Functions\\n\\n25\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n>>> def function(a): ... pass ... >>> function(0, a=0) Traceback (most recent call last):\\n\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\n\\nTypeError: function() got multiple values for keyword argument \\'a\\'\\n\\nWhen a ﬁnal formal parameter of the form **name is present, it receives a dictionary (see typesmapping) containing all keyword arguments except for those corresponding to a formal parameter. This may be combined with a formal parameter of the form *name (described in the next subsection) which receives a tuple containing the positional arguments beyond the formal parameter list. (*name must occur before **name.) For example, if we deﬁne a function like this:\\n\\ndef cheeseshop(kind, *arguments, **keywords): print(\"-- Do you have any\", kind, \"?\") print(\"-- I\\'m sorry, we\\'re all out of\", kind) for arg in arguments:\\n\\nprint(arg)\\n\\nprint(\"-\" * 40) for kw in keywords:\\n\\nprint(kw, \":\", keywords[kw])\\n\\nIt could be called like this:\\n\\ncheeseshop(\"Limburger\", \"It\\'s very runny, sir.\", \"It\\'s really very, VERY runny, sir.\", shopkeeper=\"Michael Palin\", client=\"John Cleese\", sketch=\"Cheese Shop Sketch\")\\n\\nand of course it would print:\\n\\n-- Do you have any Limburger ? -- I\\'m sorry, we\\'re all out of Limburger It\\'s very runny, sir. It\\'s really very, VERY runny, sir. ---------------------------------------- shopkeeper : Michael Palin client : John Cleese sketch : Cheese Shop Sketch\\n\\nNote that the order in which the keyword arguments are printed is guaranteed to match the order in which they were provided in the function call.\\n\\n4.7.3 Arbitrary Argument Lists\\n\\nFinally, the least frequently used option is to specify that a function can be called with an arbitrary number of arguments. These arguments will be wrapped up in a tuple (see Tuples and Sequences). Before the variable number of arguments, zero or more normal arguments may occur.\\n\\ndef write_multiple_items(file, separator, *args):\\n\\nfile.write(separator.join(args))\\n\\nNormally, these variadic arguments will be last in the list of formal parameters, because they scoop up all remaining input arguments that are passed to the function. Any formal parameters which occur after\\n\\n26\\n\\nChapter 4. More Control Flow Tools\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nthe *args parameter are ‘keyword-only’ arguments, meaning that they can only be used as keywords rather than positional arguments.\\n\\n>>> def concat(*args, sep=\"/\"): ... ... >>> concat(\"earth\", \"mars\", \"venus\") \\'earth/mars/venus\\' >>> concat(\"earth\", \"mars\", \"venus\", sep=\".\") \\'earth.mars.venus\\'\\n\\nreturn sep.join(args)\\n\\n4.7.4 Unpacking Argument Lists\\n\\nThe reverse situation occurs when the arguments are already in a list or tuple but need to be unpacked for a function call requiring separate positional arguments. For instance, the built-in range() function expects separate start and stop arguments. If they are not available separately, write the function call with the *-operator to unpack the arguments out of a list or tuple:\\n\\n>>> list(range(3, 6)) [3, 4, 5] >>> args = [3, 6] >>> list(range(*args)) [3, 4, 5]\\n\\n# normal call with separate arguments\\n\\n# call with arguments unpacked from a list\\n\\nIn the same fashion, dictionaries can deliver keyword arguments with the **-operator:\\n\\n>>> def parrot(voltage, state=\\'a stiff\\', action=\\'voom\\'): ... ... ... ... >>> d = {\"voltage\": \"four million\", \"state\": \"bleedin\\' demised\", \"action\": \"VOOM\"} >>> parrot(**d) -- This parrot wouldn\\'t VOOM if you put four million volts through it. E\\'s bleedin\\' demised !\\n\\nprint(\"-- This parrot wouldn\\'t\", action, end=\\' \\') print(\"if you put\", voltage, \"volts through it.\", end=\\' \\') print(\"E\\'s\", state, \"!\")\\n\\n4.7.5 Lambda Expressions\\n\\nSmall anonymous functions can be created with the lambda keyword. This function returns the sum of its two arguments: lambda a, b: a+b. Lambda functions can be used wherever function objects are required. They are syntactically restricted to a single expression. Semantically, they are just syntactic sugar for a normal function deﬁnition. Like nested function deﬁnitions, lambda functions can reference variables from the containing scope:\\n\\n>>> def make_incrementor(n): ... ... >>> f = make_incrementor(42) >>> f(0) 42 >>> f(1) 43\\n\\nreturn lambda x: x + n\\n\\nThe above example uses a lambda expression to return a function. Another use is to pass a small function as an argument:\\n\\n4.7.

For brevity, it should not explicitly state the object’s name or type, since these are available by other means (except if the name happens to be a verb describing a function’s operation). This line should begin with a capital letter and end with a period.\\n\\nIf there are more lines in the documentation string, the second line should be blank, visually separating the summary from the rest of the description. The following lines should be one or more paragraphs describing the object’s calling conventions, its side eﬀects, etc.\\n\\nThe Python parser does not strip indentation from multi-line string literals in Python, so tools that process documentation have to strip indentation if desired. This is done using the following convention. The ﬁrst non-blank line after the ﬁrst line of the string determines the amount of indentation for the entire documentation string. (We can’t use the ﬁrst line since it is generally adjacent to the string’s opening quotes so its indentation is not apparent in the string literal.) Whitespace “equivalent” to this indentation is then stripped from the start of all lines of the string. Lines that are indented less should not occur, but if they occur all their leading whitespace should be stripped. Equivalence of whitespace should be tested after expansion of tabs (to 8 spaces, normally).\\n\\nHere is an example of a multi-line docstring:\\n\\n>>> def my_function(): ... ... ... ... ... ... >>> print(my_function.__doc__) Do nothing, but document it.\\n\\n\"\"\"Do nothing, but document it.\\n\\nNo, really, it doesn\\'t do anything. \"\"\" pass\\n\\nNo, really, it doesn\\'t do anything.\\n\\n4.7.7 Function Annotations\\n\\nFunction annotations are completely optional metadata information about the types used by user-deﬁned functions (see PEP 3107 and PEP 484 for more information).\\n\\nAnnotations are stored in the __annotations__ attribute of the function as a dictionary and have no eﬀect on any other part of the function. Parameter annotations are deﬁned by a colon after the parameter name, followed by an expression evaluating to the value of the annotation. Return annotations are deﬁned by a literal ->, followed by an expression, between the parameter list and the colon denoting the end of the def statement. The following example has a positional argument, a keyword argument, and the return value annotated:\\n\\n>>> def f(ham: str, eggs: str = \\'eggs\\') -> str: ...\\n\\nprint(\"Annotations:\", f.__annotations__)\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n28\\n\\nChapter 4. More Control Flow Tools\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n(continued from previous page)\\n\\n... ... ... >>> f(\\'spam\\') Annotations: {\\'ham\\': <class \\'str\\'>, \\'return\\': <class \\'str\\'>, \\'eggs\\': <class \\'str\\'>} Arguments: spam eggs \\'spam and eggs\\'\\n\\nprint(\"Arguments:\", ham, eggs) return ham + \\' and \\' + eggs\\n\\n4.8 Intermezzo: Coding Style\\n\\nNow that you are about to write longer, more complex pieces of Python, it is a good time to talk about coding style. Most languages can be written (or more concise, formatted) in diﬀerent styles; some are more readable than others. Making it easy for others to read your code is always a good idea, and adopting a nice coding style helps tremendously for that.\\n\\nit promotes a very For Python, PEP 8 has emerged as the style guide that most projects adhere to; readable and eye-pleasing coding style. Every Python developer should read it at some point; here are the most important points extracted for you:\\n\\nUse 4-space indentation, and no tabs.\\n\\n4 spaces are a good compromise between small indentation (allows greater nesting depth) and large indentation (easier to read). Tabs introduce confusion, and are best left out.\\n\\nWrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters.\\n\\nThis helps users with small displays and makes it possible to have several code ﬁles side-by-side on larger displays.\\n\\nUse blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.\\n\\nWhen possible, put comments on a line of their own.\\n\\nUse docstrings.\\n\\nUse spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs: a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4).\\n\\nName your classes and functions consistently; the convention is to use CamelCase for classes and lower_case_with_underscores for functions and methods. Always use self as the name for the ﬁrst method argument (see A First Look at Classes for more on classes and methods).\\n\\nDon’t use fancy encodings if your code is meant to be used in international environments. Python’s default, UTF-8, or even plain ASCII work best in any case.\\n\\nLikewise, don’t use non-ASCII characters in identiﬁers if there is only the slightest chance people speaking a diﬀerent language will read or maintain the code.\\n\\n4.8.\\n\\nIntermezzo: Coding Style\\n\\n29\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n30\\n\\nChapter 4. More Control Flow Tools\\n\\nCHAPTER\\n\\nFIVE\\n\\nDATA STRUCTURES\\n\\nThis chapter describes some things you’ve learned about already in more detail, and adds some new things as well.\\n\\n5.1 More on Lists\\n\\nThe list data type has some more methods. Here are all of the methods of list objects:\\n\\nlist.append(x)\\n\\nAdd an item to the end of the list. Equivalent to a[len(a):] = [x].\\n\\nlist.extend(iterable)\\n\\nExtend the list by appending all the items from the iterable. Equivalent to a[len(a):] = iterable.\\n\\nlist.insert(i, x)\\n\\nInsert an item at a given position. The ﬁrst argument is the index of the element before which to insert, so a.insert(0, x) inserts at the front of the list, and a.insert(len(a), x) is equivalent to a.append(x).\\n\\nlist.remove(x)\\n\\nRemove the ﬁrst item from the list whose value is equal to x. It raises a ValueError if there is no such item. list.pop([i])\\n\\nRemove the item at the given position in the list, and return it. If no index is speciﬁed, a.pop() removes and returns the last item in the list. (The square brackets around the i in the method signature denote that the parameter is optional, not that you should type square brackets at that position. You will see this notation frequently in the Python Library Reference.)\\n\\nlist.clear()\\n\\nRemove all items from the list. Equivalent to del a[:].\\n\\nlist.index(x[, start[, end]])\\n\\nReturn zero-based index in the list of the ﬁrst item whose value is equal to x. Raises a ValueError if there is no such item.\\n\\nThe optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in the slice notation and are used to limit the search to a particular subsequence of the list. The returned index is computed relative to the beginning of the full sequence rather than the start argument.\\n\\nlist.count(x)\\n\\nReturn the number of times x appears in the list.\\n\\nlist.sort(key=None, reverse=False)\\n\\nSort the items of the list in place (the arguments can be used for sort customization, see sorted() for their explanation).\\n\\n31\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nlist.reverse()\\n\\nReverse the elements of the list in place.\\n\\nlist.copy()\\n\\nReturn a shallow copy of the list. Equivalent to a[:].\\n\\nAn example that uses most of the list methods:\\n\\n>>> fruits = [\\'orange\\', \\'apple\\', \\'pear\\', \\'banana\\', \\'kiwi\\', \\'apple\\', \\'banana\\'] >>> fruits.count(\\'apple\\') 2 >>> fruits.count(\\'tangerine\\') 0 >>> fruits.index(\\'banana\\') 3 >>> fruits.index(\\'banana\\', 4) # Find next banana starting a position 4 6 >>> fruits.reverse() >>> fruits [\\'banana\\', \\'apple\\', \\'kiwi\\', \\'banana\\', \\'pear\\', \\'apple\\', \\'orange\\'] >>> fruits.append(\\'grape\\') >>> fruits [\\'banana\\', \\'apple\\', \\'kiwi\\', \\'banana\\', \\'pear\\', \\'apple\\', \\'orange\\', \\'grape\\'] >>> fruits.sort() >>> fruits [\\'apple\\', \\'apple\\', \\'banana\\', \\'banana\\', \\'grape\\', \\'kiwi\\', \\'orange\\', \\'pear\\'] >>> fruits.pop() \\'pear\\'\\n\\nYou might have noticed that methods like insert, remove or sort that only modify the list have no return value printed – they return the default None.1 This is a design principle for all mutable data structures in Python.\\n\\n5.1.1 Using Lists as Stacks\\n\\nThe list methods make it very easy to use a list as a stack, where the last element added is the ﬁrst element retrieved (“last-in, ﬁrst-out”). To add an item to the top of the stack, use append(). To retrieve an item from the top of the stack, use pop() without an explicit index. For example:\\n\\n>>> stack = [3, 4, 5] >>> stack.append(6) >>> stack.append(7) >>> stack [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] >>> stack.pop() 7 >>> stack [3, 4, 5, 6] >>> stack.pop() 6 >>> stack.pop() 5 >>> stack [3, 4]\\n\\n1 Other\\n\\nreturn d->insert(\"a\")->remove(\"b\")->sort();.\\n\\nlanguages may\\n\\nthe mutated\\n\\nobject,\\n\\nwhich\\n\\nallows method\\n\\nchaining,\\n\\nsuch\\n\\n32\\n\\nChapter 5. Data Structures\\n\\nas\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n5.1.2 Using Lists as Queues\\n\\nIt is also possible to use a list as a queue, where the ﬁrst element added is the ﬁrst element retrieved (“ﬁrst-in, ﬁrst-out”); however, lists are not eﬃcient for this purpose. While appends and pops from the end of list are fast, doing inserts or pops from the beginning of a list is slow (because all of the other elements have to be shifted by one).\\n\\nTo implement a queue, use collections.deque which was designed to have fast appends and pops from both ends. For example:\\n\\n>>> from collections import deque >>> queue = deque([\"Eric\", \"John\", \"Michael\"]) >>> queue.append(\"Terry\") >>> queue.append(\"Graham\") >>> queue.popleft() \\'Eric\\' >>> queue.popleft() \\'John\\' >>> queue deque([\\'Michael\\', \\'Terry\\', \\'Graham\\'])\\n\\n# Terry arrives # Graham arrives # The first to arrive now leaves\\n\\n# The second to arrive now leaves\\n\\n# Remaining queue in order of arrival\\n\\n5.1.3 List Comprehensions\\n\\nList comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Common applications are to make new lists where each element is the result of some operations applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain condition.\\n\\nFor example, assume we want to create a list of squares, like:\\n\\n>>> squares = [] >>> for x in range(10): ... ... >>> squares [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]\\n\\nsquares.append(x**2)\\n\\nNote that this creates (or overwrites) a variable named x that still exists after the loop completes. We can calculate the list of squares without any side eﬀects using:\\n\\nsquares = list(map(lambda x: x**2, range(10)))\\n\\nor, equivalently:\\n\\nsquares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\\n\\nwhich is more concise and readable.\\n\\nA list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses. The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the context of the for and if clauses which follow it. For example, this listcomp combines the elements of two lists if they are not equal:\\n\\n>>> [(x, y) for x in [1,2,3] for y in [3,1,4] if x != y] [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]\\n\\nand it’s equivalent to:\\n\\n5.1. More on Lists\\n\\n33\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n>>> combs = [] >>> for x in [1,2,3]: ... ... ... ... >>> combs [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]\\n\\nfor y in [3,1,4]: if x != y:\\n\\ncombs.append((x, y))\\n\\nNote how the order of the for and if statements is the same in both these snippets.\\n\\nIf the expression is a tuple (e.g. the (x, y) in the previous example), it must be parenthesized.\\n\\n>>> vec = [-4, -2, 0, 2, 4] >>> # create a new list with the values doubled >>> [x*2 for x in vec] [-8, -4, 0, 4, 8] >>> # filter the list to exclude negative numbers >>> [x for x in vec if x >= 0] [0, 2, 4] >>> # apply a function to all the elements >>> [abs(x) for x in vec] [4, 2, 0, 2, 4] >>> # call a method on each element >>> freshfruit = [\\' banana\\', \\' loganberry \\', \\'passion fruit >>> [weapon.strip() for weapon in freshfruit] [\\'banana\\', \\'loganberry\\', \\'passion fruit\\'] >>> # create a list of 2-tuples like (number, square) >>> [(x, x**2) for x in range(6)] [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9), (4, 16), (5, 25)] >>> # the tuple must be parenthesized, otherwise an error is raised >>> [x, x**2 for x in range(6)]\\n\\n\\']\\n\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\n\\n[x, x**2 for x in range(6)]\\n\\n^\\n\\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax >>> # flatten a list using a listcomp with two \\'for\\' >>> vec = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]] >>> [num for elem in vec for num in elem] [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\\n\\nList comprehensions can contain complex expressions and nested functions:\\n\\n>>> from math import pi >>> [str(round(pi, i)) for i in range(1, 6)] [\\'3.1\\', \\'3.14\\', \\'3.142\\', \\'3.1416\\', \\'3.14159\\']\\n\\n5.1.4 Nested List Comprehensions\\n\\nThe initial expression in a list comprehension can be any arbitrary expression, including another list com- prehension.\\n\\nConsider the following example of a 3x4 matrix implemented as a list of 3 lists of length 4:\\n\\n>>> matrix = [ ... ...\\n\\n[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8],\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n34\\n\\nChapter 5. Data Structures\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n(continued from previous page)\\n\\n... ... ]\\n\\n[9, 10, 11, 12],\\n\\nThe following list comprehension will transpose rows and columns:\\n\\n>>> [[row[i] for row in matrix] for i in range(4)] [[1, 5, 9], [2, 6, 10], [3, 7, 11], [4, 8, 12]]\\n\\nAs we saw in the previous section, the nested listcomp is evaluated in the context of the for that follows it, so this example is equivalent to:\\n\\n>>> transposed = [] >>> for i in range(4): ... ... >>> transposed [[1, 5, 9], [2, 6, 10], [3, 7, 11], [4, 8, 12]]\\n\\ntransposed.append([row[i] for row in matrix])\\n\\nwhich, in turn, is the same as:\\n\\n>>> transposed = [] >>> for i in range(4): ... ... ... ... ... ... >>> transposed [[1, 5, 9], [2, 6, 10], [3, 7, 11], [4, 8, 12]]\\n\\n# the following 3 lines implement the nested listcomp transposed_row = [] for row in matrix:\\n\\ntransposed_row.append(row[i]) transposed.append(transposed_row)\\n\\nIn the real world, you should prefer built-in functions to complex ﬂow statements. The zip() function would do a great job for this use case:\\n\\n>>> list(zip(*matrix)) [(1, 5, 9), (2, 6, 10), (3, 7, 11), (4, 8, 12)]\\n\\nSee Unpacking Argument Lists for details on the asterisk in this line.\\n\\n5.2 The del statement\\n\\nThere is a way to remove an item from a list given its index instead of its value: the del statement. This diﬀers from the pop() method which returns a value. The del statement can also be used to remove slices from a list or clear the entire list (which we did earlier by assignment of an empty list to the slice). For example:\\n\\n>>> a = [-1, 1, 66.25, 333, 333, 1234.5] >>> del a[0] >>> a [1, 66.25, 333, 333, 1234.5] >>> del a[2:4] >>> a [1, 66.25, 1234.5] >>> del a[:]\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n5.2. The del statement\\n\\n35\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n(continued from previous page)\\n\\n>>> a []\\n\\ndel can also be used to delete entire variables:\\n\\n>>> del a\\n\\nReferencing the name a hereafter is an error (at least until another value is assigned to it). We’ll ﬁnd other uses for del later.\\n\\n5.3 Tuples and Sequences\\n\\nWe saw that lists and strings have many common properties, such as indexing and slicing operations. They are two examples of sequence data types (see typesseq). Since Python is an evolving language, other sequence data types may be added. There is also another standard sequence data type: the tuple.\\n\\nA tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas, for instance:\\n\\n>>> t = 12345, 54321, \\'hello!\\' >>> t[0] 12345 >>> t (12345, 54321, \\'hello!\\') >>> # Tuples may be nested: ... u = t, (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) >>> u ((12345, 54321, \\'hello!\\'), (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) >>> # Tuples are immutable: ... t[0] = 88888 Traceback (most recent call last):\\n\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\n\\nTypeError: \\'tuple\\' object does not support item assignment >>> # but they can contain mutable objects: ... v = ([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1]) >>> v ([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1])\\n\\nAs you see, on output tuples are always enclosed in parentheses, so that nested tuples are interpreted correctly; they may be input with or without surrounding parentheses, although often parentheses are necessary anyway (if the tuple is part of a larger expression). It is not possible to assign to the individual items of a tuple, however it is possible to create tuples which contain mutable objects, such as lists.\\n\\nThough tuples may seem similar to lists, they are often used in diﬀerent situations and for diﬀerent purposes. Tuples are immutable, and usually contain a heterogeneous sequence of elements that are accessed via unpacking (see later in this section) or indexing (or even by attribute in the case of namedtuples). Lists are mutable, and their elements are usually homogeneous and are accessed by iterating over the list.\\n\\nA special problem is the construction of tuples containing 0 or 1 items: the syntax has some extra quirks to accommodate these. Empty tuples are constructed by an empty pair of parentheses; a tuple with one item is constructed by following a value with a comma (it is not suﬃcient to enclose a single value in parentheses). Ugly, but eﬀective. For example:\\n\\n>>> empty = () >>> singleton = \\'hello\\', >>> len(empty)\\n\\n# <-- note trailing comma\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n36\\n\\nChapter 5. Data Structures\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n(continued from previous page)\\n\\n0 >>> len(singleton) 1 >>> singleton (\\'hello\\',)\\n\\nThe statement t = 12345, 54321, \\'hello!\\' is an example of tuple packing: the values 12345, 54321 and \\'hello!\\' are packed together in a tuple. The reverse operation is also possible:\\n\\n>>> x, y, z = t\\n\\nThis is called, appropriately enough, sequence unpacking and works for any sequence on the right-hand side. Sequence unpacking requires that there are as many variables on the left side of the equals sign as there are elements in the sequence. Note that multiple assignment is really just a combination of tuple packing and sequence unpacking.\\n\\n5.4 Sets\\n\\nPython also includes a data type for sets. A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements. Basic uses include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. Set objects also support mathematical operations like union, intersection, diﬀerence, and symmetric diﬀerence.\\n\\nCurly braces or the set() function can be used to create sets. Note: to create an empty set you have to use set(), not {}; the latter creates an empty dictionary, a data structure that we discuss in the next section.\\n\\nHere is a brief demonstration:\\n\\n>>> basket = {\\'apple\\', \\'orange\\', \\'apple\\', \\'pear\\', \\'orange\\', \\'banana\\'} >>> print(basket) {\\'orange\\', \\'banana\\', \\'pear\\', \\'apple\\'} >>> \\'orange\\' in basket True >>> \\'crabgrass\\' in basket False\\n\\n# show that duplicates have been removed\\n\\n# fast membership testing\\n\\n>>> # Demonstrate set operations on unique letters from two words ... >>> a = set(\\'abracadabra\\') >>> b = set(\\'alacazam\\') >>> a {\\'a\\', \\'r\\', \\'b\\', \\'c\\', \\'d\\'} >>> a - b {\\'r\\', \\'d\\', \\'b\\'} >>> a | b {\\'a\\', \\'c\\', \\'r\\', \\'d\\', \\'b\\', \\'m\\', \\'z\\', \\'l\\'} >>> a & b {\\'a\\', \\'c\\'} >>> a ^ b {\\'r\\', \\'d\\', \\'b\\', \\'m\\', \\'z\\', \\'l\\'}\\n\\n# unique letters in a\\n\\n# letters in a but not in b\\n\\n# letters in a or b or both\\n\\n# letters in both a and b\\n\\n# letters in a or b but not both\\n\\nSimilarly to list comprehensions, set comprehensions are also supported:\\n\\n>>> a = {x for x in \\'abracadabra\\' if x not in \\'abc\\'} >>> a {\\'r\\', \\'d\\'}\\n\\n5.4. Sets\\n\\n37\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n5.5 Dictionaries\\n\\nAnother useful data type built into Python is the dictionary (see typesmapping). Dictionaries are sometimes found in other languages as “associative memories” or “associative arrays”. Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key. You can’t use lists as keys, since lists can be modiﬁed in place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like append() and extend().\\n\\nIt is best to think of a dictionary as a set of key: value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: {}. Placing a comma-separated list of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output.\\n\\nThe main operations on a dictionary are storing a value with some key and extracting the value given the key. It is also possible to delete a key:value pair with del. If you store using a key that is already in use, the old value associated with that key is forgotten. It is an error to extract a value using a non-existent key.\\n\\nPerforming list(d) on a dictionary returns a list of all the keys used in the dictionary, in insertion order (if you want it sorted, just use sorted(d) instead). To check whether a single key is in the dictionary, use the in keyword.\\n\\nHere is a small example using a dictionary:\\n\\n>>> tel = {\\'jack\\': 4098, \\'sape\\': 4139} >>> tel[\\'guido\\'] = 4127 >>> tel {\\'jack\\': 4098, \\'sape\\': 4139, \\'guido\\': 4127} >>> tel[\\'jack\\'] 4098 >>> del tel[\\'sape\\'] >>> tel[\\'irv\\'] = 4127 >>> tel {\\'jack\\': 4098, \\'guido\\': 4127, \\'irv\\': 4127} >>> list(tel) [\\'jack\\', \\'guido\\', \\'irv\\'] >>> sorted(tel) [\\'guido\\', \\'irv\\', \\'jack\\'] >>> \\'guido\\' in tel True >>> \\'jack\\' not in tel False\\n\\nThe dict() constructor builds dictionaries directly from sequences of key-value pairs:\\n\\n>>> dict([(\\'sape\\', 4139), (\\'guido\\', 4127), (\\'jack\\', 4098)]) {\\'sape\\': 4139, \\'guido\\': 4127, \\'jack\\': 4098}\\n\\nIn addition, dict comprehensions can be used to create dictionaries from arbitrary key and value expressions:\\n\\n>>> {x: x**2 for x in (2, 4, 6)} {2: 4, 4: 16, 6: 36}\\n\\nWhen the keys are simple strings, it is sometimes easier to specify pairs using keyword arguments:\\n\\n>>> dict(sape=4139, guido=4127, jack=4098) {\\'sape\\': 4139, \\'guido\\': 4127, \\'jack\\': 4098}\\n\\n38\\n\\nChapter 5. Data Structures\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n5.6 Looping Techniques\\n\\nWhen looping through dictionaries, the key and corresponding value can be retrieved at the same time using the items() method.\\n\\n>>> knights = {\\'gallahad\\': \\'the pure\\', \\'robin\\': \\'the brave\\'} >>> for k, v in knights.items(): ... ... gallahad the pure robin the brave\\n\\nprint(k, v)\\n\\nWhen looping through a sequence, the position index and corresponding value can be retrieved at the same time using the enumerate() function.\\n\\n>>> for i, v in enumerate([\\'tic\\', \\'tac\\', \\'toe\\']): ... ... 0 tic 1 tac 2 toe\\n\\nprint(i, v)\\n\\nTo loop over two or more sequences at the same time, the entries can be paired with the zip() function.\\n\\n>>> questions = [\\'name\\', \\'quest\\', \\'favorite color\\'] >>> answers = [\\'lancelot\\', \\'the holy grail\\', \\'blue\\'] >>> for q, a in zip(questions, answers): ... ... What is your name? It is lancelot. What is your quest? It is the holy grail. What is your favorite color? It is blue.\\n\\nprint(\\'What is your {0}? It is {1}.\\'.format(q, a))\\n\\nTo loop over a sequence in reverse, ﬁrst specify the sequence in a forward direction and then call the reversed() function.\\n\\n>>> for i in reversed(range(1, 10, 2)): ... ... 9 7 5 3 1\\n\\nprint(i)\\n\\nTo loop over a sequence in sorted order, use the sorted() function which returns a new sorted list while leaving the source unaltered.\\n\\n>>> basket = [\\'apple\\', \\'orange\\', \\'apple\\', \\'pear\\', \\'orange\\', \\'banana\\'] >>> for f in sorted(set(basket)): ... ... apple banana orange pear\\n\\nprint(f)\\n\\n5.6. Looping Techniques\\n\\n39\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nIt is sometimes tempting to change a list while you are looping over it; however, it is often simpler and safer to create a new list instead.\\n\\n>>> import math >>> raw_data = [56.2, float(\\'NaN\\'), 51.7, 55.3, 52.5, float(\\'NaN\\'), 47.8] >>> filtered_data = [] >>> for value in raw_data: ... ... ... >>> filtered_data [56.2, 51.7, 55.3, 52.5, 47.8]\\n\\nif not math.isnan(value):\\n\\nfiltered_data.append(value)\\n\\n5.7 More on Conditions\\n\\nThe conditions used in while and if statements can contain any operators, not just comparisons.\\n\\nThe comparison operators in and not in check whether a value occurs (does not occur) in a sequence. The operators is and is not compare whether two objects are really the same object; this only matters for mutable objects like lists. All comparison operators have the same priority, which is lower than that of all numerical operators.\\n\\nComparisons can be chained. For example, a < b == c tests whether a is less than b and moreover b equals c.\\n\\nComparisons may be combined using the Boolean operators and and or, and the outcome of a comparison (or of any other Boolean expression) may be negated with not. These have lower priorities than comparison operators; between them, not has the highest priority and or the lowest, so that A and not B or C is equivalent to (A and (not B)) or C. As always, parentheses can be used to express the desired composition.\\n\\nThe Boolean operators and and or are so-called short-circuit operators: their arguments are evaluated from left to right, and evaluation stops as soon as the outcome is determined. For example, if A and C are true but B is false, A and B and C does not evaluate the expression C. When used as a general value and not as a Boolean, the return value of a short-circuit operator is the last evaluated argument.\\n\\nIt is possible to assign the result of a comparison or other Boolean expression to a variable. For example,\\n\\n>>> string1, string2, string3 = \\'\\', \\'Trondheim\\', \\'Hammer Dance\\' >>> non_null = string1 or string2 or string3 >>> non_null \\'Trondheim\\'\\n\\nNote that in Python, unlike C, assignment cannot occur inside expressions. C programmers may grumble about this, but it avoids a common class of problems encountered in C programs: typing = in an expression when == was intended.\\n\\n5.8 Comparing Sequences and Other Types\\n\\nSequence objects may be compared to other objects with the same sequence type. The comparison uses lex- icographical ordering: ﬁrst the ﬁrst two items are compared, and if they diﬀer this determines the outcome of the comparison; if they are equal, the next two items are compared, and so on, until either sequence is exhausted. If two items to be compared are themselves sequences of the same type, the lexicographical com- parison is carried out recursively. If all items of two sequences compare equal, the sequences are considered equal. If one sequence is an initial sub-sequence of the other, the shorter sequence is the smaller (lesser)\\n\\n40\\n\\nChapter 5. Data Structures\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\none. Lexicographical ordering for strings uses the Unicode code point number to order individual characters. Some examples of comparisons between sequences of the same type:\\n\\n(1, 2, 3) [1, 2, 3] \\'ABC\\' < \\'C\\' < \\'Pascal\\' < \\'Python\\' (1, 2, 3, 4) (1, 2) (1, 2, 3) (1, 2, (\\'aa\\', \\'ab\\'))\\n\\n< (1, 2, 4) < [1, 2, 4]\\n\\n< (1, 2, 4) < (1, 2, -1)\\n\\n== (1.0, 2.0, 3.0)\\n\\n< (1, 2, (\\'abc\\', \\'a\\'), 4)\\n\\nNote that comparing objects of diﬀerent types with < or > is legal provided that the objects have appropriate comparison methods. For example, mixed numeric types are compared according to their numeric value, so 0 equals 0.0, etc. Otherwise, rather than providing an arbitrary ordering, the interpreter will raise a TypeError exception.\\n\\n5.8. Comparing Sequences and Other Types\\n\\n41\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n42\\n\\nChapter 5. Data Structures\\n\\nCHAPTER\\n\\nSIX\\n\\nMODULES\\n\\nIf you quit from the Python interpreter and enter it again, the deﬁnitions you have made (functions and variables) are lost. Therefore, if you want to write a somewhat longer program, you are better oﬀ using a text editor to prepare the input for the interpreter and running it with that ﬁle as input instead. This is known as creating a script. As your program gets longer, you may want to split it into several ﬁles for easier maintenance. You may also want to use a handy function that you’ve written in several programs without copying its deﬁnition into each program.\\n\\nTo support this, Python has a way to put deﬁnitions in a ﬁle and use them in a script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter. Such a ﬁle is called a module; deﬁnitions from a module can be imported into other modules or into the main module (the collection of variables that you have access to in a script executed at the top level and in calculator mode).\\n\\nA module is a ﬁle containing Python deﬁnitions and statements. The ﬁle name is the module name with the suﬃx .py appended. Within a module, the module’s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable __name__. For instance, use your favorite text editor to create a ﬁle called fibo.py in the current directory with the following contents:\\n\\n# Fibonacci numbers module\\n\\ndef fib(n):\\n\\n# write Fibonacci series up to n\\n\\na, b = 0, 1 while a < n:\\n\\nprint(a, end=\\' \\') a, b = b, a+b\\n\\nprint()\\n\\ndef fib2(n):\\n\\n# return Fibonacci series up to n\\n\\nresult = [] a, b = 0, 1 while a < n:\\n\\nresult.append(a) a, b = b, a+b\\n\\nreturn result\\n\\nNow enter the Python interpreter and import this module with the following command:\\n\\n>>> import fibo\\n\\nThis does not enter the names of the functions deﬁned in fibo directly in the current symbol table; it only enters the module name fibo there. Using the module name you can access the functions:\\n\\n>>> fibo.fib(1000) 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 >>> fibo.fib2(100)\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n43\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n(continued from previous page)\\n\\n[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89] >>> fibo.__name__ \\'fibo\\'\\n\\nIf you intend to use a function often you can assign it to a local name:\\n\\n>>> fib = fibo.fib >>> fib(500) 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377\\n\\n6.1 More on Modules\\n\\nA module can contain executable statements as well as function deﬁnitions. These statements are intended to initialize the module. They are executed only the ﬁrst time the module name is encountered in an import statement.1 (They are also run if the ﬁle is executed as a script.)\\n\\nEach module has its own private symbol table, which is used as the global symbol table by all functions deﬁned in the module. Thus, the author of a module can use global variables in the module without worrying about accidental clashes with a user’s global variables. On the other hand, if you know what you are doing you can touch a module’s global variables with the same notation used to refer to its functions, modname.itemname.\\n\\nModules can import other modules. It is customary but not required to place all import statements at the beginning of a module (or script, for that matter). The imported module names are placed in the importing module’s global symbol table.\\n\\nThere is a variant of the import statement that imports names from a module directly into the importing module’s symbol table. For example:\\n\\n>>> from fibo import fib, fib2 >>> fib(500) 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377\\n\\nThis does not introduce the module name from which the imports are taken in the local symbol table (so in the example, fibo is not deﬁned).\\n\\nThere is even a variant to import all names that a module deﬁnes:\\n\\n>>> from fibo import * >>> fib(500) 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377\\n\\nThis imports all names except those beginning with an underscore (_). In most cases Python programmers do not use this facility since it introduces an unknown set of names into the interpreter, possibly hiding some things you have already deﬁned.\\n\\nNote that in general the practice of importing * from a module or package is frowned upon, since it often causes poorly readable code. However, it is okay to use it to save typing in interactive sessions.\\n\\nIf the module name is followed by as, then the name following as is bound directly to the imported module.\\n\\n>>> import fibo as fib >>> fib.fib(500) 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377\\n\\n1 In fact function deﬁnitions are also ‘statements’ that are ‘executed’; the execution of a module-level function deﬁnition\\n\\nenters the function name in the module’s global symbol table.\\n\\n44\\n\\nChapter 6. Modules\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nThis is eﬀectively importing the module in the same way that import fibo will do, with the only diﬀerence of it being available as fib.\\n\\nIt can also be used when utilising from with similar eﬀects:\\n\\n>>> from fibo import fib as fibonacci >>> fibonacci(500) 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377\\n\\nFor eﬃciency reasons, each module is only imported once per interpreter session. Therefore, if Note: you change your modules, you must restart the interpreter – or, if it’s just one module you want to test interactively, use importlib.reload(), e.g. import importlib; importlib.reload(modulename).\\n\\n6.1.1 Executing modules as scripts\\n\\nWhen you run a Python module with\\n\\npython fibo.py <arguments>\\n\\nthe code in the module will be executed, just as if you imported it, but with the __name__ set to \"__main__\". That means that by adding this code at the end of your module:\\n\\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\\n\\nimport sys fib(int(sys.argv[1]))\\n\\nyou can make the ﬁle usable as a script as well as an importable module, because the code that parses the command line only runs if the module is executed as the “main” ﬁle:\\n\\n$ python fibo.py 50 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34\\n\\nIf the module is imported, the code is not run:\\n\\n>>> import fibo >>>\\n\\nThis is often used either to provide a convenient user interface to a module, or for testing purposes (running the module as a script executes a test suite).\\n\\n6.1.2 The Module Search Path\\n\\nWhen a module named spam is imported, the interpreter ﬁrst searches for a built-in module with that name. If not found, it then searches for a ﬁle named spam.py in a list of directories given by the variable sys.path. sys.path is initialized from these locations:\\n\\nThe directory containing the input script (or the current directory when no ﬁle is speciﬁed).\\n\\nPYTHONPATH (a list of directory names, with the same syntax as the shell variable PATH).\\n\\nThe installation-dependent default.\\n\\nNote: On ﬁle systems which support symlinks, the directory containing the input script is calculated after the symlink is followed. In other words the directory containing the symlink is not added to the module\\n\\n6.1. More on Modules\\n\\n45\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nsearch path.\\n\\nAfter initialization, Python programs can modify sys.path. The directory containing the script being run is placed at the beginning of the search path, ahead of the standard library path. This means that scripts in that directory will be loaded instead of modules of the same name in the library directory. This is an error unless the replacement is intended. See section Standard Modules for more information.\\n\\n6.1.3 “Compiled” Python ﬁles\\n\\nTo speed up loading modules, Python caches the compiled version of each module in the __pycache__ directory under the name module.version.pyc, where the version encodes the format of the compiled ﬁle; it generally contains the Python version number. For example, in CPython release 3.3 the compiled version of spam.py would be cached as __pycache__/spam.cpython-33.pyc. This naming convention allows compiled modules from diﬀerent releases and diﬀerent versions of Python to coexist.\\n\\nPython checks the modiﬁcation date of the source against the compiled version to see if it’s out of date and needs to be recompiled. This is a completely automatic process. Also, the compiled modules are platform-independent, so the same library can be shared among systems with diﬀerent architectures.\\n\\nPython does not check the cache in two circumstances. First, it always recompiles and does not store the result for the module that’s loaded directly from the command line. Second, it does not check the cache if there is no source module. To support a non-source (compiled only) distribution, the compiled module must be in the source directory, and there must not be a source module.\\n\\nSome tips for experts:\\n\\nYou can use the -O or -OO switches on the Python command to reduce the size of a compiled module. The -O switch removes assert statements, the -OO switch removes both assert statements and __doc__ strings. Since some programs may rely on having these available, you should only use this option if you know what you’re doing. “Optimized” modules have an opt- tag and are usually smaller. Future releases may change the eﬀects of optimization.\\n\\nA program doesn’t run any faster when it is read from a .pyc ﬁle than when it is read from a .py ﬁle; the only thing that’s faster about .pyc ﬁles is the speed with which they are loaded.\\n\\nThe module compileall can create .pyc ﬁles for all modules in a directory.\\n\\nThere is more detail on this process, including a ﬂow chart of the decisions, in PEP 3147.\\n\\n6.2 Standard Modules\\n\\nPython comes with a library of standard modules, described in a separate document, the Python Library Reference (“Library Reference” hereafter). Some modules are built into the interpreter; these provide access to operations that are not part of the core of the language but are nevertheless built in, either for eﬃciency or to provide access to operating system primitives such as system calls. The set of such modules is a conﬁguration option which also depends on the underlying platform. For example, the winreg module is only provided on Windows systems. One particular module deserves some attention: sys, which is built into every Python interpreter. The variables sys.ps1 and sys.ps2 deﬁne the strings used as primary and secondary prompts:\\n\\n>>> import sys >>> sys.ps1 \\'>>> \\' >>> sys.ps2 \\'... \\'\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n46\\n\\nChapter 6. Modules\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n(continued from previous page)\\n\\n>>> sys.ps1 = \\'C> \\' C> print(\\'Yuck!\\') Yuck! C>\\n\\nThese two variables are only deﬁned if the interpreter is in interactive mode.\\n\\nThe variable sys.path is a list of strings that determines the interpreter’s search path for modules. It is initialized to a default path taken from the environment variable PYTHONPATH, or from a built-in default if PYTHONPATH is not set. You can modify it using standard list operations:\\n\\n>>> import sys >>> sys.path.append(\\'/ufs/guido/lib/python\\')\\n\\n6.3 The dir() Function\\n\\nThe built-in function dir() is used to ﬁnd out which names a module deﬁnes. It returns a sorted list of strings:\\n\\n>>> import fibo, sys >>> dir(fibo) [\\'__name__\\', \\'fib\\', \\'fib2\\'] >>> dir(sys) [\\'__displayhook__\\', \\'__doc__\\', \\'__excepthook__\\', \\'__loader__\\', \\'__name__\\',\\n\\n\\'__package__\\', \\'__stderr__\\', \\'__stdin__\\', \\'__stdout__\\', \\'_clear_type_cache\\', \\'_current_frames\\', \\'_debugmallocstats\\', \\'_getframe\\', \\'_home\\', \\'_mercurial\\', \\'_xoptions\\', \\'abiflags\\', \\'api_version\\', \\'argv\\', \\'base_exec_prefix\\', \\'base_prefix\\', \\'builtin_module_names\\', \\'byteorder\\', \\'call_tracing\\', \\'callstats\\', \\'copyright\\', \\'displayhook\\', \\'dont_write_bytecode\\', \\'exc_info\\', \\'excepthook\\', \\'exec_prefix\\', \\'executable\\', \\'exit\\', \\'flags\\', \\'float_info\\', \\'float_repr_style\\', \\'getcheckinterval\\', \\'getdefaultencoding\\', \\'getdlopenflags\\', \\'getfilesystemencoding\\', \\'getobjects\\', \\'getprofile\\', \\'getrecursionlimit\\', \\'getrefcount\\', \\'getsizeof\\', \\'getswitchinterval\\', \\'gettotalrefcount\\', \\'gettrace\\', \\'hash_info\\', \\'hexversion\\', \\'implementation\\', \\'int_info\\', \\'intern\\', \\'maxsize\\', \\'maxunicode\\', \\'meta_path\\', \\'modules\\', \\'path\\', \\'path_hooks\\', \\'path_importer_cache\\', \\'platform\\', \\'prefix\\', \\'ps1\\', \\'setcheckinterval\\', \\'setdlopenflags\\', \\'setprofile\\', \\'setrecursionlimit\\', \\'setswitchinterval\\', \\'settrace\\', \\'stderr\\', \\'stdin\\', \\'stdout\\', \\'thread_info\\', \\'version\\', \\'version_info\\', \\'warnoptions\\']\\n\\nWithout arguments, dir() lists the names you have deﬁned currently:\\n\\n>>> a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] >>> import fibo >>> fib = fibo.fib >>> dir() [\\'__builtins__\\', \\'__name__\\', \\'a\\', \\'fib\\', \\'fibo\\', \\'sys\\']\\n\\nNote that it lists all types of names: variables, modules, functions, etc.\\n\\ndir() does not list the names of built-in functions and variables. If you want a list of those, they are deﬁned in the standard module builtins:\\n\\n6.3.

For example, the module name A.B designates a submodule named B in a package named A. Just like the use of modules saves the authors of diﬀerent modules from having to worry about each other’s global variable names, the use of dotted module names saves the authors of multi-module packages like NumPy or Pillow from having to worry about each other’s module names.\\n\\nSuppose you want to design a collection of modules (a “package”) for the uniform handling of sound ﬁles and sound data. There are many diﬀerent sound ﬁle formats (usually recognized by their extension, for example: .wav, .aiff, .au), so you may need to create and maintain a growing collection of modules for the conversion between the various ﬁle formats. There are also many diﬀerent operations you might want to perform on sound data (such as mixing, adding echo, applying an equalizer function, creating an artiﬁcial stereo eﬀect), so in addition you will be writing a never-ending stream of modules to perform these operations. Here’s a possible structure for your package (expressed in terms of a hierarchical ﬁlesystem):\\n\\nsound/\\n\\n__init__.py formats/\\n\\nTop-level package Initialize the sound package Subpackage for file format conversions\\n\\n__init__.py wavread.py wavwrite.py\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n48\\n\\nChapter 6. Modules\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n(continued from previous page)\\n\\naiffread.py aiffwrite.py auread.py auwrite.py ...\\n\\neffects/\\n\\nSubpackage for sound effects\\n\\n__init__.py echo.py surround.py reverse.py ...\\n\\nfilters/\\n\\nSubpackage for filters\\n\\n__init__.py equalizer.py vocoder.py karaoke.py ...\\n\\nWhen importing the package, Python searches through the directories on sys.path looking for the package subdirectory.\\n\\nThe __init__.py ﬁles are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later on the module search path. In the simplest case, __init__.py can just be an empty ﬁle, but it can also execute initialization code for the package or set the __all__ variable, described later.\\n\\nUsers of the package can import individual modules from the package, for example:\\n\\nimport sound.effects.echo\\n\\nThis loads the submodule sound.effects.echo. It must be referenced with its full name.\\n\\nsound.effects.echo.echofilter(input, output, delay=0.7, atten=4)\\n\\nAn alternative way of importing the submodule is:\\n\\nfrom sound.effects import echo\\n\\nThis also loads the submodule echo, and makes it available without its package preﬁx, so it can be used as follows:\\n\\necho.echofilter(input, output, delay=0.7, atten=4)\\n\\nYet another variation is to import the desired function or variable directly:\\n\\nfrom sound.effects.echo import echofilter\\n\\nAgain, this loads the submodule echo, but this makes its function echofilter() directly available:\\n\\nechofilter(input, output, delay=0.7, atten=4)\\n\\nNote that when using from package import item, the item can be either a submodule (or subpackage) of the package, or some other name deﬁned in the package, like a function, class or variable. The import statement ﬁrst tests whether the item is deﬁned in the package; if not, it assumes it is a module and attempts to load it. If it fails to ﬁnd it, an ImportError exception is raised.\\n\\nContrarily, when using syntax like import item.subitem.subsubitem, each item except for the last must be a package; the last item can be a module or a package but can’t be a class or function or variable deﬁned\\n\\n6.4. Packages\\n\\n49\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nin the previous item.\\n\\n6.4.1 Importing * From a Package\\n\\nNow what happens when the user writes from sound.effects import *? Ideally, one would hope that this somehow goes out to the ﬁlesystem, ﬁnds which submodules are present in the package, and imports them all. This could take a long time and importing sub-modules might have unwanted side-eﬀects that should only happen when the sub-module is explicitly imported.\\n\\nThe only solution is for the package author to provide an explicit index of the package. The import statement uses the following convention: if a package’s __init__.py code deﬁnes a list named __all__, it is taken to be the list of module names that should be imported when from package import * is encountered. It is up to the package author to keep this list up-to-date when a new version of the package is released. Package authors may also decide not to support it, if they don’t see a use for importing * from their package. For example, the ﬁle sound/effects/__init__.py could contain the following code:\\n\\n__all__ = [\"echo\", \"surround\", \"reverse\"]\\n\\nThis would mean that from sound.effects import * would import the three named submodules of the sound package.\\n\\nIf __all__ is not deﬁned, the statement from sound.effects import * does not import all submodules from the package sound.effects into the current namespace; it only ensures that the package sound.effects has been imported (possibly running any initialization code in __init__.py) and then imports whatever names are deﬁned in the package. This includes any names deﬁned (and submodules explicitly loaded) by __init__.py. It also includes any submodules of the package that were explicitly loaded by previous import statements. Consider this code:\\n\\nimport sound.effects.echo import sound.effects.surround from sound.effects import *\\n\\nIn this example, the echo and surround modules are imported in the current namespace because they are deﬁned in the sound.effects package when the from...import statement is executed. (This also works when __all__ is deﬁned.)\\n\\nAlthough certain modules are designed to export only names that follow certain patterns when you use import *, it is still considered bad practice in production code.\\n\\nRemember, there is nothing wrong with using from Package import specific_submodule! In fact, this is the recommended notation unless the importing module needs to use submodules with the same name from diﬀerent packages.\\n\\n6.4.2 Intra-package References\\n\\nWhen packages are structured into subpackages (as with the sound package in the example), you can use absolute imports to refer to submodules of siblings packages. For example, if the module sound.filters. vocoder needs to use the echo module in the sound.effects package, it can use from sound.effects import echo.\\n\\nYou can also write relative imports, with the from module import name form of import statement. These imports use leading dots to indicate the current and parent packages involved in the relative import. From the surround module for example, you might use:\\n\\n50\\n\\nChapter 6. Modules\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nfrom . import echo from .. import formats from ..filters import equalizer\\n\\nNote that relative imports are based on the name of the current module. Since the name of the main module is always \"__main__\", modules intended for use as the main module of a Python application must always use absolute imports.\\n\\n6.4.3 Packages in Multiple Directories\\n\\nPackages support one more special attribute, __path__. This is initialized to be a list containing the name of the directory holding the package’s __init__.py before the code in that ﬁle is executed. This variable can be modiﬁed; doing so aﬀects future searches for modules and subpackages contained in the package.\\n\\nWhile this feature is not often needed, it can be used to extend the set of modules found in a package.\\n\\n6.4. Packages\\n\\n51\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n52\\n\\nChapter 6. Modules\\n\\nCHAPTER\\n\\nSEVEN\\n\\nINPUT AND OUTPUT\\n\\nThere are several ways to present the output of a program; data can be printed in a human-readable form, or written to a ﬁle for future use. This chapter will discuss some of the possibilities.\\n\\n7.1 Fancier Output Formatting\\n\\nSo far we’ve encountered two ways of writing values: expression statements and the print() function. (A third way is using the write() method of ﬁle objects; the standard output ﬁle can be referenced as sys.stdout. See the Library Reference for more information on this.)\\n\\nOften you’ll want more control over the formatting of your output than simply printing space-separated values. There are several ways to format output.\\n\\nTo use formatted string literals, begin a string with f or F before the opening quotation mark or triple quotation mark. Inside this string, you can write a Python expression between { and } characters that can refer to variables or literal values.\\n\\n>>> year = 2016 ; event = \\'Referendum\\' >>> f\\'Results of the {year} {event}\\' \\'Results of the 2016 Referendum\\'\\n\\nThe str.format() method of strings requires more manual eﬀort. You’ll still use { and } to mark where a variable will be substituted and can provide detailed formatting directives, but you’ll also need to provide the information to be formatted.\\n\\n>>> yes_votes = 42_572_654 ; no_votes = 43_132_495 >>> percentage = yes_votes/(yes_votes+no_votes) >>> \\'{:-9} YES votes \\' 42572654 YES votes 49.67%\\'\\n\\n{:2.2%}\\'.format(yes_votes, percentage)\\n\\nFinally, you can do all the string handling yourself by using string slicing and concatenation operations to create any layout you can imagine. The string type has some methods that perform useful operations for padding strings to a given column width.\\n\\nWhen you don’t need fancy output but just want a quick display of some variables for debugging purposes, you can convert any value to a string with the repr() or str() functions.\\n\\nThe str() function is meant to return representations of values which are fairly human-readable, while repr() is meant to generate representations which can be read by the interpreter (or will force a SyntaxError if there is no equivalent syntax). For objects which don’t have a particular representation for human con- sumption, str() will return the same value as repr(). Many values, such as numbers or structures like lists and dictionaries, have the same representation using either function. Strings, in particular, have two distinct representations.\\n\\nSome examples:\\n\\n53\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n>>> s = \\'Hello, world.\\' >>> str(s) \\'Hello, world.\\' >>> repr(s) \"\\'Hello, world.\\'\" >>> str(1/7) \\'0.14285714285714285\\' >>> x = 10 * 3.25 >>> y = 200 * 200 >>> s = \\'The value of x is \\' + repr(x) + \\', and y is \\' + repr(y) + \\'...\\' >>> print(s) The value of x is 32.5, and y is 40000... >>> # The repr() of a string adds string quotes and backslashes: ... hello = \\'hello, world\\\\n\\' >>> hellos = repr(hello) >>> print(hellos) \\'hello, world\\\\n\\' >>> # The argument to repr() may be any Python object: ... repr((x, y, (\\'spam\\', \\'eggs\\'))) \"(32.5, 40000, (\\'spam\\', \\'eggs\\'))\"\\n\\nThe string module contains a Template class that oﬀers yet another way to substitute values into strings, using placeholders like $x and replacing them with values from a dictionary, but oﬀers much less control of the formatting.\\n\\n7.1.1 Formatted String Literals\\n\\nFormatted string literals (also called f-strings for short) let you include the value of Python expressions inside a string by preﬁxing the string with f or F and writing expressions as {expression}.\\n\\nAn optional format speciﬁer can follow the expression. This allows greater control over how the value is formatted. The following example rounds pi to three places after the decimal:\\n\\n>>> import math >>> print(f\\'The value of pi is approximately {math.pi:.3f}.\\')\\n\\nPassing an integer after the \\':\\' will cause that ﬁeld to be a minimum number of characters wide. This is useful for making columns line up.\\n\\n>>> table = {\\'Sjoerd\\': 4127, \\'Jack\\': 4098, \\'Dcab\\': 7678} >>> for name, phone in table.items(): ... ... Sjoerd Jack Dcab\\n\\nprint(f\\'{name:10} ==> {phone:10d}\\')\\n\\n==> ==> ==>\\n\\n4127 4098 7678\\n\\nOther modiﬁers can be used to convert the value before it is formatted. \\'!a\\' applies ascii(), \\'!s\\' applies str(), and \\'!r\\' applies repr():\\n\\n>>> animals = \\'eels\\' >>> print(f\\'My hovercraft is full of {animals}.\\') My hovercraft is full of eels. >>> print(\\'My hovercraft is full of {animals !r}.\\') My hovercraft is full of \\'eels\\'.\\n\\nFor a reference on these format speciﬁcations, see the reference guide for the formatspec.\\n\\n54\\n\\nChapter 7.\\n\\nInput and Output\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n7.1.2 The String format() Method\\n\\nBasic usage of the str.format() method looks like this:\\n\\n>>> print(\\'We are the {} who say \"{}!\"\\'.format(\\'knights\\', \\'Ni\\')) We are the knights who say \"Ni!\"\\n\\nThe brackets and characters within them (called format ﬁelds) are replaced with the objects passed into the str.format() method. A number in the brackets can be used to refer to the position of the object passed into the str.format() method.\\n\\n>>> print(\\'{0} and {1}\\'.format(\\'spam\\', \\'eggs\\')) spam and eggs >>> print(\\'{1} and {0}\\'.format(\\'spam\\', \\'eggs\\')) eggs and spam\\n\\nIf keyword arguments are used in the str.format() method, their values are referred to by using the name of the argument.\\n\\n>>> print(\\'This {food} is {adjective}.\\'.format( ... This spam is absolutely horrible.\\n\\nfood=\\'spam\\', adjective=\\'absolutely horrible\\'))\\n\\nPositional and keyword arguments can be arbitrarily combined:\\n\\n>>> print(\\'The story of {0}, {1}, and {other}.\\'.format(\\'Bill\\', \\'Manfred\\',\\n\\nother=\\'Georg\\'))\\n\\nThe story of Bill, Manfred, and Georg.\\n\\nIf you have a really long format string that you don’t want to split up, it would be nice if you could reference the variables to be formatted by name instead of by position. This can be done by simply passing the dict and using square brackets \\'[]\\' to access the keys\\n\\n>>> table = {\\'Sjoerd\\': 4127, \\'Jack\\': 4098, \\'Dcab\\': 8637678} >>> print(\\'Jack: {0[Jack]:d}; Sjoerd: {0[Sjoerd]:d}; \\' ... \\'Dcab: {0[Dcab]:d}\\'.format(table)) Jack: 4098; Sjoerd: 4127; Dcab: 8637678\\n\\nThis could also be done by passing the table as keyword arguments with the ‘**’ notation.\\n\\n>>> table = {\\'Sjoerd\\': 4127, \\'Jack\\': 4098, \\'Dcab\\': 8637678} >>> print(\\'Jack: {Jack:d}; Sjoerd: {Sjoerd:d}; Dcab: {Dcab:d}\\'.format(**table)) Jack: 4098; Sjoerd: 4127; Dcab: 8637678\\n\\nThis is particularly useful in combination with the built-in function vars(), which returns a dictionary containing all local variables.\\n\\nAs an example, the following lines produce a tidily-aligned set of columns giving integers and their squares and cubes:\\n\\n>>> for x in range(1, 11): ... ... 1 1 4 2 9 3 4 16 5 25\\n\\nprint(\\'{0:2d} {1:3d} {2:4d}\\'.format(x, x*x, x*x*x))\\n\\n1 8 27 64 125\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n7.1. Fancier Output Formatting\\n\\n55\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n(continued from previous page)\\n\\n216 343 512 729 10 100 1000\\n\\n6 36 7 49 8 64 9 81\\n\\nFor a complete overview of string formatting with str.format(), see formatstrings.\\n\\n7.1.3 Manual String Formatting\\n\\nHere’s the same table of squares and cubes, formatted manually:\\n\\n>>> for x in range(1, 11): ... ... ... ... 1 1 4 2 3 9 4 16 5 25 6 36 7 49 8 64 9 81\\n\\nprint(repr(x).rjust(2), repr(x*x).rjust(3), end=\\' \\') # Note use of \\'end\\' on previous line print(repr(x*x*x).rjust(4))\\n\\n1 8 27 64 125 216 343 512 729 10 100 1000\\n\\n(Note that the one space between each column was added by the way print() works: it always adds spaces between its arguments.)\\n\\nThe str.rjust() method of string objects right-justiﬁes a string in a ﬁeld of a given width by padding it with spaces on the left. There are similar methods str.ljust() and str.center(). These methods do not write anything, they just return a new string. If the input string is too long, they don’t truncate it, but return it unchanged; this will mess up your column lay-out but that’s usually better than the alternative, which would be lying about a value. (If you really want truncation you can always add a slice operation, as in x.ljust(n)[:n].)\\n\\nThere is another method, str.zfill(), which pads a numeric string on the left with zeros. It understands about plus and minus signs:\\n\\n>>> \\'12\\'.zfill(5) \\'00012\\' >>> \\'-3.14\\'.zfill(7) \\'-003.14\\' >>> \\'3.14159265359\\'.zfill(5) \\'3.14159265359\\'\\n\\n7.1.4 Old string formatting\\n\\nThe % operator can also be used for string formatting. It interprets the left argument much like a sprintf()- style format string to be applied to the right argument, and returns the string resulting from this formatting operation. For example:\\n\\n56\\n\\nChapter 7.\\n\\nInput and Output\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n>>> import math >>> print(\\'The value of pi is approximately %5.3f.\\' % math.pi) The value of pi is approximately 3.142.\\n\\nMore information can be found in the old-string-formatting section.\\n\\n7.2 Reading and Writing Files\\n\\nopen() returns a ﬁle object, and is most commonly used with two arguments: open(filename, mode).\\n\\n>>> f = open(\\'workfile\\', \\'w\\')\\n\\nThe ﬁrst argument is a string containing the ﬁlename. The second argument is another string containing a few characters describing the way in which the ﬁle will be used. mode can be \\'r\\' when the ﬁle will only be read, \\'w\\' for only writing (an existing ﬁle with the same name will be erased), and \\'a\\' opens the ﬁle for appending; any data written to the ﬁle is automatically added to the end. \\'r+\\' opens the ﬁle for both reading and writing. The mode argument is optional; \\'r\\' will be assumed if it’s omitted.\\n\\nNormally, ﬁles are opened in text mode, that means, you read and write strings from and to the ﬁle, which are encoded in a speciﬁc encoding. If encoding is not speciﬁed, the default is platform dependent (see open()). \\'b\\' appended to the mode opens the ﬁle in binary mode: now the data is read and written in the form of bytes objects. This mode should be used for all ﬁles that don’t contain text.\\n\\nIn text mode, the default when reading is to convert platform-speciﬁc line endings (\\\\n on Unix, \\\\r\\\\n on Windows) to just \\\\n. When writing in text mode, the default is to convert occurrences of \\\\n back to platform-speciﬁc line endings. This behind-the-scenes modiﬁcation to ﬁle data is ﬁne for text ﬁles, but will corrupt binary data like that in JPEG or EXE ﬁles. Be very careful to use binary mode when reading and writing such ﬁles.\\n\\nIt is good practice to use the with keyword when dealing with ﬁle objects. The advantage is that the ﬁle is properly closed after its suite ﬁnishes, even if an exception is raised at some point. Using with is also much shorter than writing equivalent try-finally blocks:\\n\\n>>> with open(\\'workfile\\') as f: ... >>> f.closed True\\n\\nread_data = f.read()\\n\\nIf you’re not using the with keyword, then you should call f.close() to close the ﬁle and immediately free up any system resources used by it. If you don’t explicitly close a ﬁle, Python’s garbage collector will eventually destroy the object and close the open ﬁle for you, but the ﬁle may stay open for a while. Another risk is that diﬀerent Python implementations will do this clean-up at diﬀerent times.\\n\\nAfter a ﬁle object is closed, either by a with statement or by calling f.close(), attempts to use the ﬁle object will automatically fail.\\n\\n>>> f.close() >>> f.read() Traceback (most recent call last):\\n\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\n\\nValueError: I/O operation on closed file.\\n\\n7.2.1 Methods of File Objects\\n\\nThe rest of the examples in this section will assume that a ﬁle object called f has already been created.\\n\\n7.2. Reading and Writing Files\\n\\n57\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nTo read a ﬁle’s contents, call f.read(size), which reads some quantity of data and returns it as a string (in text mode) or bytes object (in binary mode). size is an optional numeric argument. When size is omitted or negative, the entire contents of the ﬁle will be read and returned; it’s your problem if the ﬁle is twice as large as your machine’s memory. Otherwise, at most size bytes are read and returned. If the end of the ﬁle has been reached, f.read() will return an empty string (\\'\\').\\n\\n>>> f.read() \\'This is the entire file.\\\\n\\' >>> f.read() \\'\\'\\n\\nf.readline() reads a single line from the ﬁle; a newline character (\\\\n) is left at the end of the string, and is only omitted on the last line of the ﬁle if the ﬁle doesn’t end in a newline. This makes the return value unambiguous; if f.readline() returns an empty string, the end of the ﬁle has been reached, while a blank line is represented by \\'\\\\n\\', a string containing only a single newline.\\n\\n>>> f.readline() \\'This is the first line of the file.\\\\n\\' >>> f.readline() \\'Second line of the file\\\\n\\' >>> f.readline() \\'\\'\\n\\nFor reading lines from a ﬁle, you can loop over the ﬁle object. This is memory eﬃcient, fast, and leads to simple code:\\n\\n>>> for line in f: ... ... This is the first line of the file. Second line of the file\\n\\nprint(line, end=\\'\\')\\n\\nIf you want to read all the lines of a ﬁle in a list you can also use list(f) or f.readlines().\\n\\nf.write(string) writes the contents of string to the ﬁle, returning the number of characters written.\\n\\n>>> f.write(\\'This is a test\\\\n\\') 15\\n\\nOther types of objects need to be converted – either to a string (in text mode) or a bytes object (in binary mode) – before writing them:\\n\\n>>> value = (\\'the answer\\', 42) >>> s = str(value) >>> f.write(s) 18\\n\\n# convert the tuple to string\\n\\nf.tell() returns an integer giving the ﬁle object’s current position in the ﬁle represented as number of bytes from the beginning of the ﬁle when in binary mode and an opaque number when in text mode.\\n\\nTo change the ﬁle object’s position, use f.seek(offset, from_what). The position is computed from adding oﬀset to a reference point; the reference point is selected by the from_what argument. A from_what value of 0 measures from the beginning of the ﬁle, 1 uses the current ﬁle position, and 2 uses the end of the ﬁle as the reference point. from_what can be omitted and defaults to 0, using the beginning of the ﬁle as the reference point.\\n\\n>>> f = open(\\'workfile\\', \\'rb+\\') >>> f.write(b\\'0123456789abcdef\\')\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n58\\n\\nChapter 7.\\n\\nInput and Output\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n(continued from previous page)\\n\\n16 >>> f.seek(5) 5 >>> f.read(1) b\\'5\\' >>> f.seek(-3, 2) # Go to the 3rd byte before the end 13 >>> f.read(1) b\\'d\\'\\n\\n# Go to the 6th byte in the file\\n\\nIn text ﬁles (those opened without a b in the mode string), only seeks relative to the beginning of the ﬁle are allowed (the exception being seeking to the very ﬁle end with seek(0, 2)) and the only valid oﬀset values are those returned from the f.tell(), or zero. Any other oﬀset value produces undeﬁned behaviour.\\n\\nFile objects have some additional methods, such as isatty() and truncate() which are less frequently used; consult the Library Reference for a complete guide to ﬁle objects.\\n\\n7.2.2 Saving structured data with json\\n\\nStrings can easily be written to and read from a ﬁle. Numbers take a bit more eﬀort, since the read() method only returns strings, which will have to be passed to a function like int(), which takes a string like \\'123\\' and returns its numeric value 123. When you want to save more complex data types like nested lists and dictionaries, parsing and serializing by hand becomes complicated.\\n\\nRather than having users constantly writing and debugging code to save complicated data types to ﬁles, Python allows you to use the popular data interchange format called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). The standard module called json can take Python data hierarchies, and convert them to string represen- tations; this process is called serializing. Reconstructing the data from the string representation is called deserializing. Between serializing and deserializing, the string representing the object may have been stored in a ﬁle or data, or sent over a network connection to some distant machine.\\n\\nNote: The JSON format is commonly used by modern applications to allow for data exchange. Many programmers are already familiar with it, which makes it a good choice for interoperability.\\n\\nIf you have an object x, you can view its JSON string representation with a simple line of code:\\n\\n>>> import json >>> json.dumps([1, \\'simple\\', \\'list\\']) \\'[1, \"simple\", \"list\"]\\'\\n\\nAnother variant of the dumps() function, called dump(), simply serializes the object to a text ﬁle. So if f is a text ﬁle object opened for writing, we can do this:\\n\\njson.dump(x, f)\\n\\nTo decode the object again, if f is a text ﬁle object which has been opened for reading:\\n\\nx = json.load(f)\\n\\nThis simple serialization technique can handle lists and dictionaries, but serializing arbitrary class instances in JSON requires a bit of extra eﬀort. The reference for the json module contains an explanation of this.\\n\\nSee also:\\n\\npickle - the pickle module\\n\\n7.2. Reading and Writing Files\\n\\n59\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nContrary to JSON, pickle is a protocol which allows the serialization of arbitrarily complex Python objects. As such, it is speciﬁc to Python and cannot be used to communicate with applications written in other languages. It is also insecure by default: deserializing pickle data coming from an untrusted source can execute arbitrary code, if the data was crafted by a skilled attacker.\\n\\n60\\n\\nChapter 7.\\n\\nInput and Output\\n\\nCHAPTER\\n\\nEIGHT\\n\\nERRORS AND EXCEPTIONS\\n\\nUntil now error messages haven’t been more than mentioned, but if you have tried out the examples you have probably seen some. There are (at least) two distinguishable kinds of errors: syntax errors and exceptions.\\n\\n8.1 Syntax Errors\\n\\nSyntax errors, also known as parsing errors, are perhaps the most common kind of complaint you get while you are still learning Python:\\n\\n>>> while True print(\\'Hello world\\')\\n\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1\\n\\nwhile True print(\\'Hello world\\') ^\\n\\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\\n\\nThe parser repeats the oﬀending line and displays a little ‘arrow’ pointing at the earliest point in the line where the error was detected. The error is caused by (or at least detected at) the token preceding the arrow: in the example, the error is detected at the function print(), since a colon (\\':\\') is missing before it. File name and line number are printed so you know where to look in case the input came from a script.\\n\\n8.2 Exceptions\\n\\nEven if a statement or expression is syntactically correct, it may cause an error when an attempt is made to execute it. Errors detected during execution are called exceptions and are not unconditionally fatal: you will soon learn how to handle them in Python programs. Most exceptions are not handled by programs, however, and result in error messages as shown here:\\n\\n>>> 10 * (1/0) Traceback (most recent call last):\\n\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\n\\nZeroDivisionError: division by zero >>> 4 + spam*3 Traceback (most recent call last):\\n\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module> NameError: name \\'spam\\' is not defined >>> \\'2\\' + 2 Traceback (most recent call last):\\n\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\n\\nTypeError: Can\\'t convert \\'int\\' object to str implicitly\\n\\n61\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nThe last line of the error message indicates what happened. Exceptions come in diﬀerent types, and the type is printed as part of the message: the types in the example are ZeroDivisionError, NameError and TypeError. The string printed as the exception type is the name of the built-in exception that occurred. This is true for all built-in exceptions, but need not be true for user-deﬁned exceptions (although it is a useful convention). Standard exception names are built-in identiﬁers (not reserved keywords).\\n\\nThe rest of the line provides detail based on the type of exception and what caused it.\\n\\nThe preceding part of the error message shows the context where the exception happened, in the form of a stack traceback. In general it contains a stack traceback listing source lines; however, it will not display lines read from standard input.\\n\\nbltin-exceptions lists the built-in exceptions and their meanings.\\n\\n8.3 Handling Exceptions\\n\\nIt is possible to write programs that handle selected exceptions. Look at the following example, which asks the user for input until a valid integer has been entered, but allows the user to interrupt the program (using Control-C or whatever the operating system supports); note that a user-generated interruption is signalled by raising the KeyboardInterrupt exception.\\n\\n>>> while True: ... ... ... ... ... ...\\n\\ntry:\\n\\nx = int(input(\"Please enter a number: \")) break\\n\\nexcept ValueError:\\n\\nprint(\"Oops! That was no valid number.\\n\\nTry again...\")\\n\\nThe try statement works as follows.\\n\\nFirst, the try clause (the statement(s) between the try and except keywords) is executed.\\n\\nIf no exception occurs, the except clause is skipped and execution of the try statement is ﬁnished.\\n\\nIf an exception occurs during execution of the try clause, the rest of the clause is skipped. Then if its type matches the exception named after the except keyword, the except clause is executed, and then execution continues after the try statement.\\n\\nIf an exception occurs which does not match the exception named in the except clause, it is passed on to outer try statements; if no handler is found, it is an unhandled exception and execution stops with a message as shown above.\\n\\nA try statement may have more than one except clause, to specify handlers for diﬀerent exceptions. At most one handler will be executed. Handlers only handle exceptions that occur in the corresponding try clause, not in other handlers of the same try statement. An except clause may name multiple exceptions as a parenthesized tuple, for example:\\n\\n... except (RuntimeError, TypeError, NameError): ...\\n\\npass\\n\\nA class in an except clause is compatible with an exception if it is the same class or a base class thereof (but not the other way around — an except clause listing a derived class is not compatible with a base class). For example, the following code will print B, C, D in that order:\\n\\nclass B(Exception):\\n\\npass\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n62\\n\\nChapter 8. Errors and Exceptions\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n(continued from previous page)\\n\\nclass C(B): pass\\n\\nclass D(C): pass\\n\\nfor cls in [B, C, D]:\\n\\ntry:\\n\\nraise cls()\\n\\nexcept D:\\n\\nprint(\"D\")\\n\\nexcept C:\\n\\nprint(\"C\")\\n\\nexcept B:\\n\\nprint(\"B\")\\n\\nNote that if the except clauses were reversed (with except B ﬁrst), it would have printed B, B, B — the ﬁrst matching except clause is triggered.\\n\\nThe last except clause may omit the exception name(s), to serve as a wildcard. Use this with extreme caution, since it is easy to mask a real programming error in this way! It can also be used to print an error message and then re-raise the exception (allowing a caller to handle the exception as well):\\n\\nimport sys\\n\\ntry:\\n\\nf = open(\\'myfile.txt\\') s = f.readline() i = int(s.strip()) except OSError as err:\\n\\nprint(\"OS error: {0}\".format(err))\\n\\nexcept ValueError:\\n\\nprint(\"Could not convert data to an integer.\")\\n\\nexcept:\\n\\nprint(\"Unexpected error:\", sys.exc_info()[0]) raise\\n\\nThe try … except statement has an optional else clause, which, when present, must follow all except clauses. It is useful for code that must be executed if the try clause does not raise an exception. For example:\\n\\nfor arg in sys.argv[1:]:\\n\\ntry:\\n\\nf = open(arg, \\'r\\')\\n\\nexcept OSError:\\n\\nprint(\\'cannot open\\', arg)\\n\\nelse:\\n\\nprint(arg, \\'has\\', len(f.readlines()), \\'lines\\') f.close()\\n\\nThe use of the else clause is better than adding additional code to the try clause because it avoids acciden- tally catching an exception that wasn’t raised by the code being protected by the try … except statement.\\n\\nWhen an exception occurs, it may have an associated value, also known as the exception’s argument. The presence and type of the argument depend on the exception type.\\n\\nThe except clause may specify a variable after the exception name. The variable is bound to an exception instance with the arguments stored in instance.args. For convenience, the exception instance deﬁnes __str__() so the arguments can be printed directly without having to reference .args. One may also\\n\\n8.3. Handling Exceptions\\n\\n63\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\ninstantiate an exception ﬁrst before raising it and add any attributes to it as desired.\\n\\n>>> try: ... ... except Exception as inst: ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... <class \\'Exception\\'> (\\'spam\\', \\'eggs\\') (\\'spam\\', \\'eggs\\') x = spam y = eggs\\n\\nraise Exception(\\'spam\\', \\'eggs\\')\\n\\nprint(type(inst)) print(inst.args) print(inst)\\n\\n# the exception instance # arguments stored in .args # __str__ allows args to be printed directly, # but may be overridden in exception subclasses # unpack args\\n\\nx, y = inst.args print(\\'x =\\', x) print(\\'y =\\', y)\\n\\nIf an exception has arguments, they are printed as the last part (‘detail’) of the message for unhandled exceptions.\\n\\nException handlers don’t just handle exceptions if they occur immediately in the try clause, but also if they occur inside functions that are called (even indirectly) in the try clause. For example:\\n\\n>>> def this_fails(): ... ... >>> try: ... ... except ZeroDivisionError as err: ... ... Handling run-time error: division by zero\\n\\nx = 1/0\\n\\nthis_fails()\\n\\nprint(\\'Handling run-time error:\\', err)\\n\\n8.4 Raising Exceptions\\n\\nThe raise statement allows the programmer to force a speciﬁed exception to occur. For example:\\n\\n>>> raise NameError(\\'HiThere\\') Traceback (most recent call last):\\n\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\n\\nNameError: HiThere\\n\\nThe sole argument to raise indicates the exception to be raised. This must be either an exception instance or an exception class (a class that derives from Exception). If an exception class is passed, it will be implicitly instantiated by calling its constructor with no arguments:\\n\\nraise ValueError\\n\\n# shorthand for \\'raise ValueError()\\'\\n\\nIf you need to determine whether an exception was raised but don’t intend to handle it, a simpler form of the raise statement allows you to re-raise the exception:\\n\\n>>> try: ... ... except NameError:\\n\\nraise NameError(\\'HiThere\\')\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n64\\n\\nChapter 8. Errors and Exceptions\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n(continued from previous page)\\n\\n... ... ... An exception flew by! Traceback (most recent call last):\\n\\nprint(\\'An exception flew by!\\') raise\\n\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 2, in <module>\\n\\nNameError: HiThere\\n\\n8.5 User-deﬁned Exceptions\\n\\nPrograms may name their own exceptions by creating a new exception class (see Classes for more about Python classes). Exceptions should typically be derived from the Exception class, either directly or indi- rectly.\\n\\nException classes can be deﬁned which do anything any other class can do, but are usually kept simple, often only oﬀering a number of attributes that allow information about the error to be extracted by handlers for the exception. When creating a module that can raise several distinct errors, a common practice is to create a base class for exceptions deﬁned by that module, and subclass that to create speciﬁc exception classes for diﬀerent error conditions:\\n\\nclass Error(Exception):\\n\\n\"\"\"Base class for exceptions in this module.\"\"\" pass\\n\\nclass InputError(Error):\\n\\n\"\"\"Exception raised for errors in the input.\\n\\nAttributes:\\n\\nexpression -- input expression in which the error occurred message -- explanation of the error\\n\\n\"\"\"\\n\\ndef __init__(self, expression, message):\\n\\nself.expression = expression self.message = message\\n\\nclass TransitionError(Error):\\n\\n\"\"\"Raised when an operation attempts a state transition that\\'s not allowed.\\n\\nAttributes:\\n\\nprevious -- state at beginning of transition next -- attempted new state message -- explanation of why the specific transition is not allowed\\n\\n\"\"\"\\n\\ndef __init__(self, previous, next, message):\\n\\nself.previous = previous self.next = next self.message = message\\n\\nMost exceptions are deﬁned with names that end in “Error,” similar to the naming of the standard exceptions.\\n\\nMany standard modules deﬁne their own exceptions to report errors that may occur in functions they deﬁne. More information on classes is presented in chapter Classes.\\n\\n8.5. User-deﬁned Exceptions\\n\\n65\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n8.6 Deﬁning Clean-up Actions\\n\\nThe try statement has another optional clause which is intended to deﬁne clean-up actions that must be executed under all circumstances. For example:\\n\\n>>> try: ... ... finally: ... ... Goodbye, world! KeyboardInterrupt Traceback (most recent call last):\\n\\nraise KeyboardInterrupt\\n\\nprint(\\'Goodbye, world!\\')\\n\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 2, in <module>\\n\\nA ﬁnally clause is always executed before leaving the try statement, whether an exception has occurred or not. When an exception has occurred in the try clause and has not been handled by an except clause (or it has occurred in an except or else clause), it is re-raised after the finally clause has been executed. The finally clause is also executed “on the way out” when any other clause of the try statement is left via a break, continue or return statement. A more complicated example:\\n\\n>>> def divide(x, y): try: ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... >>> divide(2, 1) result is 2.0 executing finally clause >>> divide(2, 0) division by zero! executing finally clause >>> divide(\"2\", \"1\") executing finally clause Traceback (most recent call last):\\n\\nresult = x / y\\n\\nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\\n\\nprint(\"division by zero!\")\\n\\nelse:\\n\\nprint(\"result is\", result)\\n\\nfinally:\\n\\nprint(\"executing finally clause\")\\n\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module> File \"<stdin>\", line 3, in divide\\n\\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: \\'str\\' and \\'str\\'\\n\\nAs you can see, the finally clause is executed in any event. The TypeError raised by dividing two strings is not handled by the except clause and therefore re-raised after the finally clause has been executed.\\n\\nIn real world applications, the finally clause is useful for releasing external resources (such as ﬁles or network connections), regardless of whether the use of the resource was successful.\\n\\n8.7 Predeﬁned Clean-up Actions\\n\\nSome objects deﬁne standard clean-up actions to be undertaken when the object is no longer needed, regard- less of whether or not the operation using the object succeeded or failed. Look at the following example, which tries to open a ﬁle and print its contents to the screen.\\n\\n66\\n\\nChapter 8. Errors and Exceptions\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nfor line in open(\"myfile.txt\"):\\n\\nprint(line, end=\"\")\\n\\nThe problem with this code is that it leaves the ﬁle open for an indeterminate amount of time after this part of the code has ﬁnished executing. This is not an issue in simple scripts, but can be a problem for larger applications. The with statement allows objects like ﬁles to be used in a way that ensures they are always cleaned up promptly and correctly.\\n\\nwith open(\"myfile.txt\") as f:\\n\\nfor line in f:\\n\\nprint(line, end=\"\")\\n\\nAfter the statement is executed, the ﬁle f is always closed, even if a problem was encountered while pro- cessing the lines. Objects which, like ﬁles, provide predeﬁned clean-up actions will indicate this in their documentation.\\n\\n8.7. Predeﬁned Clean-up Actions\\n\\n67\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n68\\n\\nChapter 8. Errors and Exceptions\\n\\nCHAPTER\\n\\nNINE\\n\\nCLASSES\\n\\nClasses provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (deﬁned by its class) for modifying its state.\\n\\nCompared with other programming languages, Python’s class mechanism adds classes with a minimum of new syntax and semantics. It is a mixture of the class mechanisms found in C++ and Modula-3. Python classes provide all the standard features of Object Oriented Programming: the class inheritance mechanism allows multiple base classes, a derived class can override any methods of its base class or classes, and a method can call the method of a base class with the same name. Objects can contain arbitrary amounts and kinds of data. As is true for modules, classes partake of the dynamic nature of Python: they are created at runtime, and can be modiﬁed further after creation.\\n\\nIn C++ terminology, normally class members (including the data members) are public (except see below Private Variables), and all member functions are virtual. As in Modula-3, there are no shorthands for referencing the object’s members from its methods: the method function is declared with an explicit ﬁrst argument representing the object, which is provided implicitly by the call. As in Smalltalk, classes themselves are objects. This provides semantics for importing and renaming. Unlike C++ and Modula-3, built-in types can be used as base classes for extension by the user. Also, like in C++, most built-in operators with special syntax (arithmetic operators, subscripting etc.) can be redeﬁned for class instances.\\n\\n(Lacking universally accepted terminology to talk about classes, I will make occasional use of Smalltalk and C++ terms. I would use Modula-3 terms, since its object-oriented semantics are closer to those of Python than C++, but I expect that few readers have heard of it.)\\n\\n9.1 A Word About Names and Objects\\n\\nObjects have individuality, and multiple names (in multiple scopes) can be bound to the same object. This is known as aliasing in other languages. This is usually not appreciated on a ﬁrst glance at Python, and can be safely ignored when dealing with immutable basic types (numbers, strings, tuples). However, aliasing has a possibly surprising eﬀect on the semantics of Python code involving mutable objects such as lists, dictionaries, and most other types. This is usually used to the beneﬁt of the program, since aliases behave like pointers in some respects. For example, passing an object is cheap since only a pointer is passed by the implementation; and if a function modiﬁes an object passed as an argument, the caller will see the change — this eliminates the need for two diﬀerent argument passing mechanisms as in Pascal.\\n\\n9.2 Python Scopes and Namespaces\\n\\nBefore introducing classes, I ﬁrst have to tell you something about Python’s scope rules. Class deﬁnitions play some neat tricks with namespaces, and you need to know how scopes and namespaces work to fully\\n\\n69\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nunderstand what’s going on. Incidentally, knowledge about this subject is useful for any advanced Python programmer.\\n\\nLet’s begin with some deﬁnitions.\\n\\nA namespace is a mapping from names to objects. Most namespaces are currently implemented as Python dictionaries, but that’s normally not noticeable in any way (except for performance), and it may change in the future. Examples of namespaces are: the set of built-in names (containing functions such as abs(), and built-in exception names); the global names in a module; and the local names in a function invocation. In a sense the set of attributes of an object also form a namespace. The important thing to know about namespaces is that there is absolutely no relation between names in diﬀerent namespaces; for instance, two diﬀerent modules may both deﬁne a function maximize without confusion — users of the modules must preﬁx it with the module name.\\n\\nBy the way, I use the word attribute for any name following a dot — for example, in the expression z. real, real is an attribute of the object z. Strictly speaking, references to names in modules are attribute references: in the expression modname.funcname, modname is a module object and funcname is an attribute of it. In this case there happens to be a straightforward mapping between the module’s attributes and the global names deﬁned in the module: they share the same namespace!1\\n\\nAttributes may be read-only or writable. In the latter case, assignment to attributes is possible. Module attributes are writable: you can write modname.the_answer = 42. Writable attributes may also be deleted with the del statement. For example, del modname.the_answer will remove the attribute the_answer from the object named by modname.\\n\\nNamespaces are created at diﬀerent moments and have diﬀerent lifetimes. The namespace containing the built-in names is created when the Python interpreter starts up, and is never deleted. The global namespace for a module is created when the module deﬁnition is read in; normally, module namespaces also last until the interpreter quits. The statements executed by the top-level invocation of the interpreter, either read from a script ﬁle or interactively, are considered part of a module called __main__, so they have their own global namespace. (The built-in names actually also live in a module; this is called builtins.)\\n\\nThe local namespace for a function is created when the function is called, and deleted when the function returns or raises an exception that is not handled within the function. (Actually, forgetting would be a better way to describe what actually happens.) Of course, recursive invocations each have their own local namespace.\\n\\nA scope is a textual region of a Python program where a namespace is directly accessible. “Directly accessible” here means that an unqualiﬁed reference to a name attempts to ﬁnd the name in the namespace.\\n\\nAlthough scopes are determined statically, they are used dynamically. At any time during execution, there are at least three nested scopes whose namespaces are directly accessible:\\n\\nthe innermost scope, which is searched ﬁrst, contains the local names\\n\\nthe scopes of any enclosing functions, which are searched starting with the nearest enclosing scope, contains non-local, but also non-global names\\n\\nthe next-to-last scope contains the current module’s global names\\n\\nthe outermost scope (searched last) is the namespace containing built-in names\\n\\nIf a name is declared global, then all references and assignments go directly to the middle scope containing the module’s global names. To rebind variables found outside of the innermost scope, the nonlocal statement can be used; if not declared nonlocal, those variables are read-only (an attempt to write to such a variable will simply create a new local variable in the innermost scope, leaving the identically named outer variable unchanged).\\n\\n1 Except for one thing. Module objects have a secret read-only attribute called __dict__ which returns the dictionary used to implement the module’s namespace; the name __dict__ is an attribute but not a global name. Obviously, using this violates the abstraction of namespace implementation, and should be restricted to things like post-mortem debuggers.\\n\\n70\\n\\nChapter 9. Classes\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nUsually, the local scope references the local names of the (textually) current function. Outside functions, the local scope references the same namespace as the global scope: the module’s namespace. Class deﬁnitions place yet another namespace in the local scope.\\n\\nIt is important to realize that scopes are determined textually: the global scope of a function deﬁned in a module is that module’s namespace, no matter from where or by what alias the function is called. On the other hand, the actual search for names is done dynamically, at run time — however, the language deﬁnition is evolving towards static name resolution, at “compile” time, so don’t rely on dynamic name resolution! (In fact, local variables are already determined statically.)\\n\\nA special quirk of Python is that – if no global statement is in eﬀect – assignments to names always go into the innermost scope. Assignments do not copy data — they just bind names to objects. The same is true for deletions: the statement del x removes the binding of x from the namespace referenced by the local scope. In fact, all operations that introduce new names use the local scope: in particular, import statements and function deﬁnitions bind the module or function name in the local scope.\\n\\nThe global statement can be used to indicate that particular variables live in the global scope and should be rebound there; the nonlocal statement indicates that particular variables live in an enclosing scope and should be rebound there.\\n\\n9.2.1 Scopes and Namespaces Example\\n\\nThis is an example demonstrating how to reference the diﬀerent scopes and namespaces, and how global and nonlocal aﬀect variable binding:\\n\\ndef scope_test():\\n\\ndef do_local():\\n\\nspam = \"local spam\"\\n\\ndef do_nonlocal():\\n\\nnonlocal spam spam = \"nonlocal spam\"\\n\\ndef do_global():\\n\\nglobal spam spam = \"global spam\"\\n\\nspam = \"test spam\" do_local() print(\"After local assignment:\", spam) do_nonlocal() print(\"After nonlocal assignment:\", spam) do_global() print(\"After global assignment:\", spam)\\n\\nscope_test() print(\"In global scope:\", spam)\\n\\nThe output of the example code is:\\n\\nAfter local assignment: test spam After nonlocal assignment: nonlocal spam After global assignment: nonlocal spam In global scope: global spam\\n\\nNote how the local assignment (which is default) didn’t change scope_test’s binding of spam. The nonlocal assignment changed scope_test’s binding of spam, and the global assignment changed the module-level binding.\\n\\n9.2. Python Scopes and Namespaces\\n\\n71\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nYou can also see that there was no previous binding for spam before the global assignment.\\n\\n9.3 A First Look at Classes\\n\\nClasses introduce a little bit of new syntax, three new object types, and some new semantics.\\n\\n9.3.1 Class Deﬁnition Syntax\\n\\nThe simplest form of class deﬁnition looks like this:\\n\\nclass ClassName:\\n\\n<statement-1> . . . <statement-N>\\n\\nClass deﬁnitions, like function deﬁnitions (def statements) must be executed before they have any eﬀect. (You could conceivably place a class deﬁnition in a branch of an if statement, or inside a function.)\\n\\nIn practice, the statements inside a class deﬁnition will usually be function deﬁnitions, but other statements are allowed, and sometimes useful — we’ll come back to this later. The function deﬁnitions inside a class normally have a peculiar form of argument list, dictated by the calling conventions for methods — again, this is explained later.\\n\\nWhen a class deﬁnition is entered, a new namespace is created, and used as the local scope — thus, all assignments to local variables go into this new namespace. In particular, function deﬁnitions bind the name of the new function here.\\n\\nWhen a class deﬁnition is left normally (via the end), a class object is created. This is basically a wrapper around the contents of the namespace created by the class deﬁnition; we’ll learn more about class objects in the next section. The original local scope (the one in eﬀect just before the class deﬁnition was entered) is reinstated, and the class object is bound here to the class name given in the class deﬁnition header (ClassName in the example).\\n\\n9.3.2 Class Objects\\n\\nClass objects support two kinds of operations: attribute references and instantiation.\\n\\nAttribute references use the standard syntax used for all attribute references in Python: obj.name. Valid attribute names are all the names that were in the class’s namespace when the class object was created. So, if the class deﬁnition looked like this:\\n\\nclass MyClass:\\n\\n\"\"\"A simple example class\"\"\" i = 12345\\n\\ndef f(self):\\n\\nreturn \\'hello world\\'\\n\\nthen MyClass.i and MyClass.f are valid attribute references, returning an integer and a function object, respectively. Class attributes can also be assigned to, so you can change the value of MyClass.i by assign- ment. __doc__ is also a valid attribute, returning the docstring belonging to the class: \"A simple example class\".\\n\\n72\\n\\nChapter 9. Classes\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nClass instantiation uses function notation. Just pretend that the class object is a parameterless function that returns a new instance of the class. For example (assuming the above class):\\n\\nx = MyClass()\\n\\ncreates a new instance of the class and assigns this object to the local variable x.\\n\\nThe instantiation operation (“calling” a class object) creates an empty object. Many classes like to create objects with instances customized to a speciﬁc initial state. Therefore a class may deﬁne a special method named __init__(), like this:\\n\\ndef __init__(self):\\n\\nself.data = []\\n\\nWhen a class deﬁnes an __init__() method, class instantiation automatically invokes __init__() for the newly-created class instance. So in this example, a new, initialized instance can be obtained by:\\n\\nx = MyClass()\\n\\nOf course, the __init__() method may have arguments for greater ﬂexibility. In that case, arguments given to the class instantiation operator are passed on to __init__(). For example,\\n\\n>>> class Complex: ... ... ... ... >>> x = Complex(3.0, -4.5) >>> x.r, x.i (3.0, -4.5)\\n\\ndef __init__(self, realpart, imagpart):\\n\\nself.r = realpart self.i = imagpart\\n\\n9.3.3 Instance Objects\\n\\nNow what can we do with instance objects? The only operations understood by instance objects are attribute references. There are two kinds of valid attribute names, data attributes and methods.\\n\\ndata attributes correspond to “instance variables” in Smalltalk, and to “data members” in C++. Data attributes need not be declared; like local variables, they spring into existence when they are ﬁrst assigned to. For example, if x is the instance of MyClass created above, the following piece of code will print the value 16, without leaving a trace:\\n\\nx.counter = 1 while x.counter < 10:\\n\\nx.counter = x.counter * 2\\n\\nprint(x.counter) del x.counter\\n\\nThe other kind of instance attribute reference is a method. A method is a function that “belongs to” an object. (In Python, the term method is not unique to class instances: other object types can have methods as well. For example, list objects have methods called append, insert, remove, sort, and so on. However, in the following discussion, we’ll use the term method exclusively to mean methods of class instance objects, unless explicitly stated otherwise.)\\n\\nValid method names of an instance object depend on its class. By deﬁnition, all attributes of a class that are function objects deﬁne corresponding methods of its instances. So in our example, x.f is a valid method reference, since MyClass.f is a function, but x.i is not, since MyClass.i is not. But x.f is not the same thing as MyClass.f — it is a method object, not a function object.\\n\\n9.3. A First Look at Classes\\n\\n73\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n9.3.4 Method Objects\\n\\nUsually, a method is called right after it is bound:\\n\\nx.f()\\n\\nIn the MyClass example, this will return the string \\'hello world\\'. However, it is not necessary to call a method right away: x.f is a method object, and can be stored away and called at a later time. For example:\\n\\nxf = x.f while True:\\n\\nprint(xf())\\n\\nwill continue to print hello world until the end of time.\\n\\nWhat exactly happens when a method is called? You may have noticed that x.f() was called without an argument above, even though the function deﬁnition for f() speciﬁed an argument. What happened to the argument? Surely Python raises an exception when a function that requires an argument is called without any — even if the argument isn’t actually used…\\n\\nActually, you may have guessed the answer: the special thing about methods is that the instance object is passed as the ﬁrst argument of the function. In our example, the call x.f() is exactly equivalent to MyClass. f(x). In general, calling a method with a list of n arguments is equivalent to calling the corresponding function with an argument list that is created by inserting the method’s instance object before the ﬁrst argument.\\n\\nIf you still don’t understand how methods work, a look at the implementation can perhaps clarify matters. When a non-data attribute of an instance is referenced, the instance’s class is searched. If the name denotes a valid class attribute that is a function object, a method object is created by packing (pointers to) the instance object and the function object just found together in an abstract object: this is the method object. When the method object is called with an argument list, a new argument list is constructed from the instance object and the argument list, and the function object is called with this new argument list.\\n\\n9.3.5 Class and Instance Variables\\n\\nGenerally speaking, instance variables are for data unique to each instance and class variables are for at- tributes and methods shared by all instances of the class:\\n\\nclass Dog:\\n\\nkind = \\'canine\\'\\n\\n# class variable shared by all instances\\n\\ndef __init__(self, name): self.name = name\\n\\n# instance variable unique to each instance\\n\\n>>> d = Dog(\\'Fido\\') >>> e = Dog(\\'Buddy\\') >>> d.kind \\'canine\\' >>> e.kind \\'canine\\' >>> d.name \\'Fido\\' >>> e.name \\'Buddy\\'\\n\\n# shared by all dogs\\n\\n# shared by all dogs\\n\\n# unique to d\\n\\n# unique to e\\n\\n74\\n\\nChapter 9. Classes\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nAs discussed in A Word About Names and Objects, shared data can have possibly surprising eﬀects with involving mutable objects such as lists and dictionaries. For example, the tricks list in the following code should not be used as a class variable because just a single list would be shared by all Dog instances:\\n\\nclass Dog:\\n\\ntricks = []\\n\\n# mistaken use of a class variable\\n\\ndef __init__(self, name): self.name = name\\n\\ndef add_trick(self, trick):\\n\\nself.tricks.append(trick)\\n\\n>>> d = Dog(\\'Fido\\') >>> e = Dog(\\'Buddy\\') >>> d.add_trick(\\'roll over\\') >>> e.add_trick(\\'play dead\\') >>> d.tricks [\\'roll over\\', \\'play dead\\']\\n\\n# unexpectedly shared by all dogs\\n\\nCorrect design of the class should use an instance variable instead:\\n\\nclass Dog:\\n\\ndef __init__(self, name): self.name = name self.tricks = []\\n\\n# creates a new empty list for each dog\\n\\ndef add_trick(self, trick):\\n\\nself.tricks.append(trick)\\n\\n>>> d = Dog(\\'Fido\\') >>> e = Dog(\\'Buddy\\') >>> d.add_trick(\\'roll over\\') >>> e.add_trick(\\'play dead\\') >>> d.tricks [\\'roll over\\'] >>> e.tricks [\\'play dead\\']\\n\\n9.4 Random Remarks\\n\\nData attributes override method attributes with the same name; to avoid accidental name conﬂicts, which may cause hard-to-ﬁnd bugs in large programs, it is wise to use some kind of convention that minimizes the chance of conﬂicts. Possible conventions include capitalizing method names, preﬁxing data attribute names with a small unique string (perhaps just an underscore), or using verbs for methods and nouns for data attributes.\\n\\nIn Data attributes may be referenced by methods as well as by ordinary users (“clients”) of an object. other words, classes are not usable to implement pure abstract data types. In fact, nothing in Python makes it possible to enforce data hiding — it is all based upon convention. (On the other hand, the Python implementation, written in C, can completely hide implementation details and control access to an object if necessary; this can be used by extensions to Python written in C.)\\n\\nClients should use data attributes with care — clients may mess up invariants maintained by the methods\\n\\n9.4. Random Remarks\\n\\n75\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nby stamping on their data attributes. Note that clients may add data attributes of their own to an instance object without aﬀecting the validity of the methods, as long as name conﬂicts are avoided — again, a naming convention can save a lot of headaches here.\\n\\nThere is no shorthand for referencing data attributes (or other methods!) from within methods. I ﬁnd that this actually increases the readability of methods: there is no chance of confusing local variables and instance variables when glancing through a method.\\n\\nOften, the ﬁrst argument of a method is called self. This is nothing more than a convention: the name self has absolutely no special meaning to Python. Note, however, that by not following the convention your code may be less readable to other Python programmers, and it is also conceivable that a class browser program might be written that relies upon such a convention.\\n\\nAny function object that is a class attribute deﬁnes a method for instances of that class. It is not necessary that the function deﬁnition is textually enclosed in the class deﬁnition: assigning a function object to a local variable in the class is also ok. For example:\\n\\n# Function defined outside the class def f1(self, x, y):\\n\\nreturn min(x, x+y)\\n\\nclass C:\\n\\nf = f1\\n\\ndef g(self):\\n\\nreturn \\'hello world\\'\\n\\nh = g\\n\\nNow f, g and h are all attributes of class C that refer to function objects, and consequently they are all methods of instances of C — h being exactly equivalent to g. Note that this practice usually only serves to confuse the reader of a program.\\n\\nMethods may call other methods by using method attributes of the self argument:\\n\\nclass Bag:\\n\\ndef __init__(self):\\n\\nself.data = []\\n\\ndef add(self, x):\\n\\nself.data.append(x)\\n\\ndef addtwice(self, x):\\n\\nself.add(x) self.add(x)\\n\\nMethods may reference global names in the same way as ordinary functions. The global scope associated with a method is the module containing its deﬁnition. (A class is never used as a global scope.) While one rarely encounters a good reason for using global data in a method, there are many legitimate uses of the global scope: for one thing, functions and modules imported into the global scope can be used by methods, as well as functions and classes deﬁned in it. Usually, the class containing the method is itself deﬁned in this global scope, and in the next section we’ll ﬁnd some good reasons why a method would want to reference its own class.\\n\\nEach value is an object, and therefore has a class (also called its type). It is stored as object.__class__.\\n\\n76\\n\\nChapter 9. Classes\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n9.5 Inheritance\\n\\nOf course, a language feature would not be worthy of the name “class” without supporting inheritance. The syntax for a derived class deﬁnition looks like this:\\n\\nclass DerivedClassName(BaseClassName):\\n\\n<statement-1> . . . <statement-N>\\n\\nThe name BaseClassName must be deﬁned in a scope containing the derived class deﬁnition. In place of a base class name, other arbitrary expressions are also allowed. This can be useful, for example, when the base class is deﬁned in another module:\\n\\nclass DerivedClassName(modname.BaseClassName):\\n\\nExecution of a derived class deﬁnition proceeds the same as for a base class. When the class object is constructed, the base class is remembered. This is used for resolving attribute references: if a requested attribute is not found in the class, the search proceeds to look in the base class. This rule is applied recursively if the base class itself is derived from some other class.\\n\\nThere’s nothing special about instantiation of derived classes: DerivedClassName() creates a new instance of the class. Method references are resolved as follows: the corresponding class attribute is searched, descending down the chain of base classes if necessary, and the method reference is valid if this yields a function object.\\n\\nDerived classes may override methods of their base classes. Because methods have no special privileges when calling other methods of the same object, a method of a base class that calls another method deﬁned in the same base class may end up calling a method of a derived class that overrides it. (For C++ programmers: all methods in Python are eﬀectively virtual.)\\n\\nAn overriding method in a derived class may in fact want to extend rather than simply replace the base class method of the same name. There is a simple way to call the base class method directly: just call BaseClassName.methodname(self, arguments). This is occasionally useful to clients as well. (Note that this only works if the base class is accessible as BaseClassName in the global scope.)\\n\\nPython has two built-in functions that work with inheritance:\\n\\nUse isinstance() to check an instance’s type: isinstance(obj, int) will be True only if obj. __class__ is int or some class derived from int.\\n\\nUse issubclass() to check class inheritance: issubclass(bool, int) is True since bool is a subclass of int. However, issubclass(float, int) is False since float is not a subclass of int.\\n\\n9.5.1 Multiple Inheritance\\n\\nPython supports a form of multiple inheritance as well. A class deﬁnition with multiple base classes looks like this:\\n\\nclass DerivedClassName(Base1, Base2, Base3):\\n\\n<statement-1> . . . <statement-N>\\n\\n9.5.\\n\\nInheritance\\n\\n77\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nFor most purposes, in the simplest cases, you can think of the search for attributes inherited from a parent class as depth-ﬁrst, left-to-right, not searching twice in the same class where there is an overlap in the hier- archy. Thus, if an attribute is not found in DerivedClassName, it is searched for in Base1, then (recursively) in the base classes of Base1, and if it was not found there, it was searched for in Base2, and so on.\\n\\nIn fact, it is slightly more complex than that; the method resolution order changes dynamically to support cooperative calls to super(). This approach is known in some other multiple-inheritance languages as call-next-method and is more powerful than the super call found in single-inheritance languages.\\n\\nDynamic ordering is necessary because all cases of multiple inheritance exhibit one or more diamond re- lationships (where at least one of the parent classes can be accessed through multiple paths from the bottommost class). For example, all classes inherit from object, so any case of multiple inheritance provides more than one path to reach object. To keep the base classes from being accessed more than once, the dynamic algorithm linearizes the search order in a way that preserves the left-to-right order- ing speciﬁed in each class, that calls each parent only once, and that is monotonic (meaning that a class can be subclassed without aﬀecting the precedence order of its parents). Taken together, these properties make it possible to design reliable and extensible classes with multiple inheritance. For more detail, see https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/.\\n\\n9.6 Private Variables\\n\\n“Private” instance variables that cannot be accessed except from inside an object don’t exist in Python. However, there is a convention that is followed by most Python code: a name preﬁxed with an underscore (e.g. _spam) should be treated as a non-public part of the API (whether it is a function, a method or a data member). It should be considered an implementation detail and subject to change without notice.\\n\\nSince there is a valid use-case for class-private members (namely to avoid name clashes of names with names deﬁned by subclasses), there is limited support for such a mechanism, called name mangling. Any identiﬁer of the form __spam (at least two leading underscores, at most one trailing underscore) is textually replaced with _classname__spam, where classname is the current class name with leading underscore(s) stripped. This mangling is done without regard to the syntactic position of the identiﬁer, as long as it occurs within the deﬁnition of a class.\\n\\nName mangling is helpful for letting subclasses override methods without breaking intraclass method calls. For example:\\n\\nclass Mapping:\\n\\ndef __init__(self, iterable): self.items_list = [] self.__update(iterable)\\n\\ndef update(self, iterable):\\n\\nfor item in iterable:\\n\\nself.items_list.append(item)\\n\\n__update = update\\n\\n# private copy of original update() method\\n\\nclass MappingSubclass(Mapping):\\n\\ndef update(self, keys, values):\\n\\n# provides new signature for update() # but does not break __init__() for item in zip(keys, values):\\n\\nself.items_list.append(item)\\n\\nNote that the mangling rules are designed mostly to avoid accidents; it still is possible to access or modify a variable that is considered private. This can even be useful in special circumstances, such as in the debugger.\\n\\n78\\n\\nChapter 9. Classes\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nNotice that code passed to exec() or eval() does not consider the classname of the invoking class to be the current class; this is similar to the eﬀect of the global statement, the eﬀect of which is likewise restricted to code that is byte-compiled together. The same restriction applies to getattr(), setattr() and delattr(), as well as when referencing __dict__ directly.\\n\\n9.7 Odds and Ends\\n\\nSometimes it is useful to have a data type similar to the Pascal “record” or C “struct”, bundling together a few named data items. An empty class deﬁnition will do nicely:\\n\\nclass Employee:\\n\\npass\\n\\njohn = Employee()\\n\\n# Create an empty employee record\\n\\n# Fill the fields of the record john.name = \\'John Doe\\' john.dept = \\'computer lab\\' john.salary = 1000\\n\\nA piece of Python code that expects a particular abstract data type can often be passed a class that emulates the methods of that data type instead. For instance, if you have a function that formats some data from a ﬁle object, you can deﬁne a class with methods read() and readline() that get the data from a string buﬀer instead, and pass it as an argument.\\n\\nInstance method objects have attributes, too: m.__self__ is the instance object with the method m(), and m.__func__ is the function object corresponding to the method.\\n\\n9.8 Iterators\\n\\nBy now you have probably noticed that most container objects can be looped over using a for statement:\\n\\nfor element in [1, 2, 3]:\\n\\nprint(element)\\n\\nfor element in (1, 2, 3):\\n\\nprint(element)\\n\\nfor key in {\\'one\\':1, \\'two\\':2}:\\n\\nprint(key) for char in \"123\": print(char)\\n\\nfor line in open(\"myfile.txt\"):\\n\\nprint(line, end=\\'\\')\\n\\nThis style of access is clear, concise, and convenient. The use of iterators pervades and uniﬁes Python. Behind the scenes, the for statement calls iter() on the container object. The function returns an iterator object that deﬁnes the method __next__() which accesses elements in the container one at a time. When there are no more elements, __next__() raises a StopIteration exception which tells the for loop to terminate. You can call the __next__() method using the next() built-in function; this example shows how it all works:\\n\\n>>> s = \\'abc\\' >>> it = iter(s) >>> it\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n9.7. Odds and Ends\\n\\n79\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n(continued from previous page)\\n\\n<iterator object at 0x00A1DB50> >>> next(it) \\'a\\' >>> next(it) \\'b\\' >>> next(it) \\'c\\' >>> next(it) Traceback (most recent call last):\\n\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\n\\nnext(it)\\n\\nStopIteration\\n\\nHaving seen the mechanics behind the iterator protocol, it is easy to add iterator behavior to your classes. Deﬁne an __iter__() method which returns an object with a __next__() method. If the class deﬁnes __next__(), then __iter__() can just return self:\\n\\nclass Reverse:\\n\\n\"\"\"Iterator for looping over a sequence backwards.\"\"\" def __init__(self, data): self.data = data self.index = len(data)\\n\\ndef __iter__(self): return self\\n\\ndef __next__(self):\\n\\nif self.index == 0:\\n\\nraise StopIteration self.index = self.index - 1 return self.data[self.index]\\n\\n>>> rev = Reverse(\\'spam\\') >>> iter(rev) <__main__.Reverse object at 0x00A1DB50> >>> for char in rev: ... ... m a p s\\n\\nprint(char)\\n\\n9.9 Generators\\n\\nGenerators are a simple and powerful tool for creating iterators. They are written like regular functions but use the yield statement whenever they want to return data. Each time next() is called on it, the generator resumes where it left oﬀ (it remembers all the data values and which statement was last executed). An example shows that generators can be trivially easy to create:\\n\\ndef reverse(data):\\n\\nfor index in range(len(data)-1, -1, -1):\\n\\nyield data[index]\\n\\n80\\n\\nChapter 9. Classes\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n>>> for char in reverse(\\'golf\\'): ... ... f l o g\\n\\nprint(char)\\n\\nAnything that can be done with generators can also be done with class-based iterators as described in the previous section. What makes generators so compact is that the __iter__() and __next__() methods are created automatically.\\n\\nAnother key feature is that the local variables and execution state are automatically saved between calls. This made the function easier to write and much more clear than an approach using instance variables like self.index and self.data.\\n\\nIn addition to automatic method creation and saving program state, when generators terminate, they au- tomatically raise StopIteration. In combination, these features make it easy to create iterators with no more eﬀort than writing a regular function.\\n\\n9.10 Generator Expressions\\n\\nSome simple generators can be coded succinctly as expressions using a syntax similar to list comprehensions but with parentheses instead of square brackets. These expressions are designed for situations where the gen- erator is used right away by an enclosing function. Generator expressions are more compact but less versatile than full generator deﬁnitions and tend to be more memory friendly than equivalent list comprehensions.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n>>> sum(i*i for i in range(10)) 285\\n\\n# sum of squares\\n\\n>>> xvec = [10, 20, 30] >>> yvec = [7, 5, 3] >>> sum(x*y for x,y in zip(xvec, yvec)) 260\\n\\n# dot product\\n\\n>>> from math import pi, sin >>> sine_table = {x: sin(x*pi/180) for x in range(0, 91)}\\n\\n>>> unique_words = set(word for line in page\\n\\nfor word in line.split())\\n\\n>>> valedictorian = max((student.gpa, student.name) for student in graduates)\\n\\n>>> data = \\'golf\\' >>> list(data[i] for i in range(len(data)-1, -1, -1)) [\\'f\\', \\'l\\', \\'o\\', \\'g\\']\\n\\n9.10. Generator Expressions\\n\\n81\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n82\\n\\nChapter 9. Classes\\n\\nCHAPTER\\n\\nTEN\\n\\nBRIEF TOUR OF THE STANDARD LIBRARY\\n\\n10.1 Operating System Interface\\n\\nThe os module provides dozens of functions for interacting with the operating system:\\n\\n>>> import os >>> os.getcwd() \\'C:\\\\\\\\Python37\\' >>> os.chdir(\\'/server/accesslogs\\') >>> os.system(\\'mkdir today\\') 0\\n\\n# Return the current working directory\\n\\n# Change current working directory\\n\\n# Run the command mkdir in the system shell\\n\\nBe sure to use the import os style instead of from os import *. This will keep os.open() from shadowing the built-in open() function which operates much diﬀerently.\\n\\nThe built-in dir() and help() functions are useful as interactive aids for working with large modules like os:\\n\\n>>> import os >>> dir(os) <returns a list of all module functions> >>> help(os) <returns an extensive manual page created from the module\\'s docstrings>\\n\\nFor daily ﬁle and directory management tasks, the shutil module provides a higher level interface that is easier to use:\\n\\n>>> import shutil >>> shutil.copyfile(\\'data.db\\', \\'archive.db\\') \\'archive.db\\' >>> shutil.move(\\'/build/executables\\', \\'installdir\\') \\'installdir\\'\\n\\n10.2 File Wildcards\\n\\nThe glob module provides a function for making ﬁle lists from directory wildcard searches:\\n\\n>>> import glob >>> glob.glob(\\'*.py\\') [\\'primes.py\\', \\'random.py\\', \\'quote.py\\']\\n\\n83\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n10.3 Command Line Arguments\\n\\nCommon utility scripts often need to process command line arguments. These arguments are stored in the sys module’s argv attribute as a list. For instance the following output results from running python demo.py one two three at the command line:\\n\\n>>> import sys >>> print(sys.argv) [\\'demo.py\\', \\'one\\', \\'two\\', \\'three\\']\\n\\nThe getopt module processes sys.argv using the conventions of the Unix getopt() function. More powerful and ﬂexible command line processing is provided by the argparse module.\\n\\n10.4 Error Output Redirection and Program Termination\\n\\nThe sys module also has attributes for stdin, stdout, and stderr. The latter is useful for emitting warnings and error messages to make them visible even when stdout has been redirected:\\n\\n>>> sys.stderr.write(\\'Warning, log file not found starting a new one\\\\n\\') Warning, log file not found starting a new one\\n\\nThe most direct way to terminate a script is to use sys.exit().\\n\\n10.5 String Pattern Matching\\n\\nThe re module provides regular expression tools for advanced string processing. For complex matching and manipulation, regular expressions oﬀer succinct, optimized solutions:\\n\\n>>> import re >>> re.findall(r\\'\\\\bf[a-z]*\\', \\'which foot or hand fell fastest\\') [\\'foot\\', \\'fell\\', \\'fastest\\'] >>> re.sub(r\\'(\\\\b[a-z]+) \\\\1\\', r\\'\\\\1\\', \\'cat in the the hat\\') \\'cat in the hat\\'\\n\\nWhen only simple capabilities are needed, string methods are preferred because they are easier to read and debug:\\n\\n>>> \\'tea for too\\'.replace(\\'too\\', \\'two\\') \\'tea for two\\'\\n\\n10.6 Mathematics\\n\\nThe math module gives access to the underlying C library functions for ﬂoating point math:\\n\\n>>> import math >>> math.cos(math.pi / 4) 0.70710678118654757 >>> math.log(1024, 2) 10.0\\n\\nThe random module provides tools for making random selections:\\n\\n84\\n\\nChapter 10. Brief Tour of the Standard Library\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n>>> import random >>> random.choice([\\'apple\\', \\'pear\\', \\'banana\\']) \\'apple\\' >>> random.sample(range(100), 10) [30, 83, 16, 4, 8, 81, 41, 50, 18, 33] >>> random.random() 0.17970987693706186 >>> random.randrange(6) 4\\n\\n# sampling without replacement\\n\\n# random float\\n\\n# random integer chosen from range(6)\\n\\nThe statistics module calculates basic statistical properties (the mean, median, variance, etc.) of numeric data:\\n\\n>>> import statistics >>> data = [2.75, 1.75, 1.25, 0.25, 0.5, 1.25, 3.5] >>> statistics.mean(data) 1.6071428571428572 >>> statistics.median(data) 1.25 >>> statistics.variance(data) 1.3720238095238095\\n\\nThe SciPy project <https://scipy.org> has many other modules for numerical computations.\\n\\n10.7 Internet Access\\n\\nThere are a number of modules for accessing the internet and processing internet protocols. Two of the simplest are urllib.request for retrieving data from URLs and smtplib for sending mail:\\n\\n>>> from urllib.request import urlopen >>> with urlopen(\\'http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/timer.pl\\') as response: ... ... ... ...\\n\\nfor line in response:\\n\\nline = line.decode(\\'utf-8\\') # Decoding the binary data to text. if \\'EST\\' in line or \\'EDT\\' in line: # look for Eastern Time\\n\\nprint(line)\\n\\n<BR>Nov. 25, 09:43:32 PM EST\\n\\n>>> import smtplib >>> server = smtplib.SMTP(\\'localhost\\') >>> server.sendmail(\\'soothsayer@example.org\\', \\'jcaesar@example.org\\', ... \"\"\"To: jcaesar@example.org ... From: soothsayer@example.org ... ... Beware the Ides of March. ... \"\"\") >>> server.quit()\\n\\n(Note that the second example needs a mailserver running on localhost.)\\n\\n10.8 Dates and Times\\n\\nThe datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times in both simple and complex ways. While date and time arithmetic is supported, the focus of the implementation is on eﬃcient member extrac-\\n\\n10.7.\\n\\nInternet Access\\n\\n85\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\ntion for output formatting and manipulation. The module also supports objects that are timezone aware.\\n\\n>>> # dates are easily constructed and formatted >>> from datetime import date >>> now = date.today() >>> now datetime.date(2003, 12, 2) >>> now.strftime(\"%m-%d-%y. %d %b %Y is a %A on the %d day of %B.\") \\'12-02-03. 02 Dec 2003 is a Tuesday on the 02 day of December.\\'\\n\\n>>> # dates support calendar arithmetic >>> birthday = date(1964, 7, 31) >>> age = now - birthday >>> age.days 14368\\n\\n10.9 Data Compression\\n\\nCommon data archiving and compression formats are directly supported by modules including: zlib, gzip, bz2, lzma, zipfile and tarfile.\\n\\n>>> import zlib >>> s = b\\'witch which has which witches wrist watch\\' >>> len(s) 41 >>> t = zlib.compress(s) >>> len(t) 37 >>> zlib.decompress(t) b\\'witch which has which witches wrist watch\\' >>> zlib.crc32(s) 226805979\\n\\n10.10 Performance Measurement\\n\\nSome Python users develop a deep interest in knowing the relative performance of diﬀerent approaches to the same problem. Python provides a measurement tool that answers those questions immediately.\\n\\nFor example, it may be tempting to use the tuple packing and unpacking feature instead of the tradi- tional approach to swapping arguments. The timeit module quickly demonstrates a modest performance advantage:\\n\\n>>> from timeit import Timer >>> Timer(\\'t=a; a=b; b=t\\', \\'a=1; b=2\\').timeit() 0.57535828626024577 >>> Timer(\\'a,b = b,a\\', \\'a=1; b=2\\').timeit() 0.54962537085770791\\n\\nIn contrast to timeit’s ﬁne level of granularity, the profile and pstats modules provide tools for identifying time critical sections in larger blocks of code.\\n\\n86\\n\\nChapter 10. Brief Tour of the Standard Library\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n10.11 Quality Control\\n\\nOne approach for developing high quality software is to write tests for each function as it is developed and to run those tests frequently during the development process.\\n\\nThe doctest module provides a tool for scanning a module and validating tests embedded in a program’s docstrings. Test construction is as simple as cutting-and-pasting a typical call along with its results into the docstring. This improves the documentation by providing the user with an example and it allows the doctest module to make sure the code remains true to the documentation:\\n\\ndef average(values):\\n\\n\"\"\"Computes the arithmetic mean of a list of numbers.\\n\\n>>> print(average([20, 30, 70])) 40.0 \"\"\" return sum(values) / len(values)\\n\\nimport doctest doctest.testmod()\\n\\n# automatically validate the embedded tests\\n\\nThe unittest module is not as eﬀortless as the doctest module, but it allows a more comprehensive set of tests to be maintained in a separate ﬁle:\\n\\nimport unittest\\n\\nclass TestStatisticalFunctions(unittest.TestCase):\\n\\ndef test_average(self):\\n\\nself.assertEqual(average([20, 30, 70]), 40.0) self.assertEqual(round(average([1, 5, 7]), 1), 4.3) with self.assertRaises(ZeroDivisionError):\\n\\naverage([])\\n\\nwith self.assertRaises(TypeError):\\n\\naverage(20, 30, 70)\\n\\nunittest.main() # Calling from the command line invokes all tests\\n\\n10.12 Batteries Included\\n\\nPython has a “batteries included” philosophy. This is best seen through the sophisticated and robust capabilities of its larger packages. For example:\\n\\nThe xmlrpc.client and xmlrpc.server modules make implementing remote procedure calls into an almost trivial task. Despite the modules names, no direct knowledge or handling of XML is needed.\\n\\nThe email package is a library for managing email messages, including MIME and other RFC 2822- based message documents. Unlike smtplib and poplib which actually send and receive messages, the email package has a complete toolset for building or decoding complex message structures (including attachments) and for implementing internet encoding and header protocols.\\n\\nThe json package provides robust support for parsing this popular data interchange format. The csv module supports direct reading and writing of ﬁles in Comma-Separated Value format, commonly sup- ported by databases and spreadsheets. XML processing is supported by the xml.etree.ElementTree, xml.dom and xml.sax packages. Together, these modules and packages greatly simplify data inter- change between Python applications and other tools.\\n\\n10.11. Quality Control\\n\\n87\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nThe sqlite3 module is a wrapper for the SQLite database library, providing a persistent database that can be updated and accessed using slightly nonstandard SQL syntax.\\n\\nInternationalization is supported by a number of modules including gettext, locale, and the codecs package.\\n\\n88\\n\\nChapter 10. Brief Tour of the Standard Library\\n\\nCHAPTER\\n\\nELEVEN\\n\\nBRIEF TOUR OF THE STANDARD LIBRARY — PART II\\n\\nThis second tour covers more advanced modules that support professional programming needs. These mod- ules rarely occur in small scripts.\\n\\n11.1 Output Formatting\\n\\nThe reprlib module provides a version of repr() customized for abbreviated displays of large or deeply nested containers:\\n\\n>>> import reprlib >>> reprlib.repr(set(\\'supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\\')) \"{\\'a\\', \\'c\\', \\'d\\', \\'e\\', \\'f\\', \\'g\\', ...}\"\\n\\nThe pprint module oﬀers more sophisticated control over printing both built-in and user deﬁned objects in a way that is readable by the interpreter. When the result is longer than one line, the “pretty printer” adds line breaks and indentation to more clearly reveal data structure:\\n\\n>>> import pprint >>> t = [[[[\\'black\\', \\'cyan\\'], \\'white\\', [\\'green\\', \\'red\\']], [[\\'magenta\\', ... ... >>> pprint.pprint(t, width=30) [[[[\\'black\\', \\'cyan\\'],\\n\\n\\'yellow\\'], \\'blue\\']]]\\n\\n\\'white\\', [\\'green\\', \\'red\\']],\\n\\n[[\\'magenta\\', \\'yellow\\'],\\n\\n\\'blue\\']]]\\n\\nThe textwrap module formats paragraphs of text to ﬁt a given screen width:\\n\\n>>> import textwrap >>> doc = \"\"\"The wrap() method is just like fill() except that it returns ... a list of strings instead of one big string with newlines to separate ... the wrapped lines.\"\"\" ... >>> print(textwrap.fill(doc, width=40)) The wrap() method is just like fill() except that it returns a list of strings instead of one big string with newlines to separate the wrapped lines.\\n\\nThe locale module accesses a database of culture speciﬁc data formats. The grouping attribute of locale’s format function provides a direct way of formatting numbers with group separators:\\n\\n89\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n>>> import locale >>> locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, \\'English_United States.1252\\') \\'English_United States.1252\\' >>> conv = locale.localeconv() >>> x = 1234567.8 >>> locale.format(\"%d\", x, grouping=True) \\'1,234,567\\' >>> locale.format_string(\"%s%.*f\", (conv[\\'currency_symbol\\'], ... \\'$1,234,567.80\\'\\n\\n# get a mapping of conventions\\n\\nconv[\\'frac_digits\\'], x), grouping=True)\\n\\n11.2 Templating\\n\\nThe string module includes a versatile Template class with a simpliﬁed syntax suitable for editing by end-users. This allows users to customize their applications without having to alter the application.\\n\\nThe format uses placeholder names formed by $ with valid Python identiﬁers (alphanumeric characters and underscores). Surrounding the placeholder with braces allows it to be followed by more alphanumeric letters with no intervening spaces. Writing $$ creates a single escaped $:\\n\\n>>> from string import Template >>> t = Template(\\'${village}folk send $$10 to $cause.\\') >>> t.substitute(village=\\'Nottingham\\', cause=\\'the ditch fund\\') \\'Nottinghamfolk send $10 to the ditch fund.\\'\\n\\nThe substitute() method raises a KeyError when a placeholder is not supplied in a dictionary or a keyword argument. For mail-merge style applications, user supplied data may be incomplete and the safe_substitute() method may be more appropriate — it will leave placeholders unchanged if data is missing:\\n\\n>>> t = Template(\\'Return the $item to $owner.\\') >>> d = dict(item=\\'unladen swallow\\') >>> t.substitute(d) Traceback (most recent call last):\\n\\n...\\n\\nKeyError: \\'owner\\' >>> t.safe_substitute(d) \\'Return the unladen swallow to $owner.\\'\\n\\nTemplate subclasses can specify a custom delimiter. For example, a batch renaming utility for a photo browser may elect to use percent signs for placeholders such as the current date, image sequence number, or ﬁle format:\\n\\n>>> import time, os.path >>> photofiles = [\\'img_1074.jpg\\', \\'img_1076.jpg\\', \\'img_1077.jpg\\'] >>> class BatchRename(Template): ... delimiter = \\'%\\' >>> fmt = input(\\'Enter rename style (%d-date %n-seqnum %f-format): Enter rename style (%d-date %n-seqnum %f-format): Ashley_%n%f\\n\\n\\')\\n\\n>>> t = BatchRename(fmt) >>> date = time.strftime(\\'%d%b%y\\') >>> for i, filename in enumerate(photofiles): ... ...\\n\\nbase, ext = os.path.splitext(filename) newname = t.substitute(d=date, n=i, f=ext)\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n90\\n\\nChapter 11.

This makes it possible to substitute custom templates for XML ﬁles, plain text reports, and HTML web reports.\\n\\n11.3 Working with Binary Data Record Layouts\\n\\nThe struct module provides pack() and unpack() functions for working with variable length binary record formats. The following example shows how to loop through header information in a ZIP ﬁle without using the zipfile module. Pack codes \"H\" and \"I\" represent two and four byte unsigned numbers respectively. The \"<\" indicates that they are standard size and in little-endian byte order:\\n\\nimport struct\\n\\nwith open(\\'myfile.zip\\', \\'rb\\') as f:\\n\\ndata = f.read()\\n\\nstart = 0 for i in range(3): start += 14 fields = struct.unpack(\\'<IIIHH\\', data[start:start+16]) crc32, comp_size, uncomp_size, filenamesize, extra_size = fields\\n\\n# show the first 3 file headers\\n\\nstart += 16 filename = data[start:start+filenamesize] start += filenamesize extra = data[start:start+extra_size] print(filename, hex(crc32), comp_size, uncomp_size)\\n\\nstart += extra_size + comp_size\\n\\n# skip to the next header\\n\\n11.4 Multi-threading\\n\\nThreading is a technique for decoupling tasks which are not sequentially dependent. Threads can be used to improve the responsiveness of applications that accept user input while other tasks run in the background. A related use case is running I/O in parallel with computations in another thread.\\n\\nThe following code shows how the high level threading module can run tasks in background while the main program continues to run:\\n\\nimport threading, zipfile\\n\\nclass AsyncZip(threading.Thread):\\n\\ndef __init__(self, infile, outfile):\\n\\nthreading.Thread.__init__(self) self.infile = infile self.outfile = outfile\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n11.3. Working with Binary Data Record Layouts\\n\\n91\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n(continued from previous page)\\n\\ndef run(self):\\n\\nf = zipfile.ZipFile(self.outfile, \\'w\\', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) f.write(self.infile) f.close() print(\\'Finished background zip of:\\', self.infile)\\n\\nbackground = AsyncZip(\\'mydata.txt\\', \\'myarchive.zip\\') background.start() print(\\'The main program continues to run in foreground.\\')\\n\\nbackground.join() print(\\'Main program waited until background was done.\\')\\n\\n# Wait for the background task to finish\\n\\nThe principal challenge of multi-threaded applications is coordinating threads that share data or other resources. To that end, the threading module provides a number of synchronization primitives including locks, events, condition variables, and semaphores.\\n\\nWhile those tools are powerful, minor design errors can result in problems that are diﬃcult to reproduce. So, the preferred approach to task coordination is to concentrate all access to a resource in a single thread and then use the queue module to feed that thread with requests from other threads. Applications using Queue objects for inter-thread communication and coordination are easier to design, more readable, and more reliable.\\n\\n11.5 Logging\\n\\nThe logging module oﬀers a full featured and ﬂexible logging system. At its simplest, log messages are sent to a ﬁle or to sys.stderr:\\n\\nimport logging logging.debug(\\'Debugging information\\') logging.info(\\'Informational message\\') logging.warning(\\'Warning:config file %s not found\\', \\'server.conf\\') logging.error(\\'Error occurred\\') logging.critical(\\'Critical error -- shutting down\\')\\n\\nThis produces the following output:\\n\\nWARNING:root:Warning:config file server.conf not found ERROR:root:Error occurred CRITICAL:root:Critical error -- shutting down\\n\\nBy default, informational and debugging messages are suppressed and the output is sent to standard er- ror. Other output options include routing messages through email, datagrams, sockets, or to an HTTP Server. New ﬁlters can select diﬀerent routing based on message priority: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.\\n\\nThe logging system can be conﬁgured directly from Python or can be loaded from a user editable conﬁguration ﬁle for customized logging without altering the application.\\n\\n92\\n\\nChapter 11. Brief Tour of the Standard Library — Part II\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n11.6 Weak References\\n\\nPython does automatic memory management (reference counting for most objects and garbage collection to eliminate cycles). The memory is freed shortly after the last reference to it has been eliminated.\\n\\nThis approach works ﬁne for most applications but occasionally there is a need to track objects only as long as they are being used by something else. Unfortunately, just tracking them creates a reference that makes them permanent. The weakref module provides tools for tracking objects without creating a reference. When the object is no longer needed, it is automatically removed from a weakref table and a callback is triggered for weakref objects. Typical applications include caching objects that are expensive to create:\\n\\n>>> import weakref, gc >>> class A: ... ... ... ... ... >>> a = A(10) >>> d = weakref.WeakValueDictionary() >>> d[\\'primary\\'] = a >>> d[\\'primary\\'] 10 >>> del a >>> gc.collect() 0 >>> d[\\'primary\\'] Traceback (most recent call last):\\n\\ndef __init__(self, value): self.value = value\\n\\ndef __repr__(self):\\n\\nreturn str(self.value)\\n\\n# create a reference\\n\\n# does not create a reference # fetch the object if it is still alive\\n\\n# remove the one reference # run garbage collection right away\\n\\n# entry was automatically removed\\n\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\n\\nd[\\'primary\\']\\n\\n# entry was automatically removed\\n\\nFile \"C:/python37/lib/weakref.py\", line 46, in __getitem__\\n\\no = self.data[key]()\\n\\nKeyError: \\'primary\\'\\n\\n11.7 Tools for Working with Lists\\n\\nMany data structure needs can be met with the built-in list type. However, sometimes there is a need for alternative implementations with diﬀerent performance trade-oﬀs.\\n\\nThe array module provides an array() object that is like a list that stores only homogeneous data and stores it more compactly. The following example shows an array of numbers stored as two byte unsigned binary numbers (typecode \"H\") rather than the usual 16 bytes per entry for regular lists of Python int objects:\\n\\n>>> from array import array >>> a = array(\\'H\\', [4000, 10, 700, 22222]) >>> sum(a) 26932 >>> a[1:3] array(\\'H\\', [10, 700])\\n\\nThe collections module provides a deque() object that is like a list with faster appends and pops from the left side but slower lookups in the middle. These objects are well suited for implementing queues and breadth ﬁrst tree searches:\\n\\n11.6. Weak References\\n\\n93\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n>>> from collections import deque >>> d = deque([\"task1\", \"task2\", \"task3\"]) >>> d.append(\"task4\") >>> print(\"Handling\", d.popleft()) Handling task1\\n\\nunsearched = deque([starting_node]) def breadth_first_search(unsearched):\\n\\nnode = unsearched.popleft() for m in gen_moves(node):\\n\\nif is_goal(m):\\n\\nreturn m\\n\\nunsearched.append(m)\\n\\nIn addition to alternative list implementations, the library also oﬀers other tools such as the bisect module with functions for manipulating sorted lists:\\n\\n>>> import bisect >>> scores = [(100, \\'perl\\'), (200, \\'tcl\\'), (400, \\'lua\\'), (500, \\'python\\')] >>> bisect.insort(scores, (300, \\'ruby\\')) >>> scores [(100, \\'perl\\'), (200, \\'tcl\\'), (300, \\'ruby\\'), (400, \\'lua\\'), (500, \\'python\\')]\\n\\nThe heapq module provides functions for implementing heaps based on regular lists. The lowest valued entry is always kept at position zero. This is useful for applications which repeatedly access the smallest element but do not want to run a full list sort:\\n\\n>>> from heapq import heapify, heappop, heappush >>> data = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0] >>> heapify(data) >>> heappush(data, -5) >>> [heappop(data) for i in range(3)] [-5, 0, 1]\\n\\n# rearrange the list into heap order # add a new entry # fetch the three smallest entries\\n\\n11.8 Decimal Floating Point Arithmetic\\n\\nThe decimal module oﬀers a Decimal datatype for decimal ﬂoating point arithmetic. Compared to the built-in float implementation of binary ﬂoating point, the class is especially helpful for\\n\\nﬁnancial applications and other uses which require exact decimal representation,\\n\\ncontrol over precision,\\n\\ncontrol over rounding to meet legal or regulatory requirements,\\n\\ntracking of signiﬁcant decimal places, or\\n\\napplications where the user expects the results to match calculations done by hand.\\n\\nFor example, calculating a 5% tax on a 70 cent phone charge gives diﬀerent results in decimal ﬂoating point and binary ﬂoating point. The diﬀerence becomes signiﬁcant if the results are rounded to the nearest cent:\\n\\n>>> from decimal import * >>> round(Decimal(\\'0.70\\') * Decimal(\\'1.05\\'), 2) Decimal(\\'0.74\\') >>> round(.70 * 1.05, 2) 0.73\\n\\n94\\n\\nChapter 11. Brief Tour of the Standard Library — Part II\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nThe Decimal result keeps a trailing zero, automatically inferring four place signiﬁcance from multiplicands with two place signiﬁcance. Decimal reproduces mathematics as done by hand and avoids issues that can arise when binary ﬂoating point cannot exactly represent decimal quantities.\\n\\nExact representation enables the Decimal class to perform modulo calculations and equality tests that are unsuitable for binary ﬂoating point:\\n\\n>>> Decimal(\\'1.00\\') % Decimal(\\'.10\\') Decimal(\\'0.00\\') >>> 1.00 % 0.10 0.09999999999999995\\n\\n>>> sum([Decimal(\\'0.1\\')]*10) == Decimal(\\'1.0\\') True >>> sum([0.1]*10) == 1.0 False\\n\\nThe decimal module provides arithmetic with as much precision as needed:\\n\\n>>> getcontext().prec = 36 >>> Decimal(1) / Decimal(7) Decimal(\\'0.142857142857142857142857142857142857\\')\\n\\n11.8. Decimal Floating Point Arithmetic\\n\\n95\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n96\\n\\nChapter 11. Brief Tour of the Standard Library — Part II\\n\\nCHAPTER\\n\\nTWELVE\\n\\nVIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS AND PACKAGES\\n\\n12.1 Introduction\\n\\nPython applications will often use packages and modules that don’t come as part of the standard library. Applications will sometimes need a speciﬁc version of a library, because the application may require that a particular bug has been ﬁxed or the application may be written using an obsolete version of the library’s interface.\\n\\nThis means it may not be possible for one Python installation to meet the requirements of every application. If application A needs version 1.0 of a particular module but application B needs version 2.0, then the requirements are in conﬂict and installing either version 1.0 or 2.0 will leave one application unable to run.\\n\\nThe solution for this problem is to create a virtual environment, a self-contained directory tree that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus a number of additional packages.\\n\\nDiﬀerent applications can then use diﬀerent virtual environments. To resolve the earlier example of conﬂicting requirements, application A can have its own virtual environment with version 1.0 installed while application B has another virtual environment with version 2.0. If application B requires a library be upgraded to version 3.0, this will not aﬀect application A’s environment.\\n\\n12.2 Creating Virtual Environments\\n\\nThe module used to create and manage virtual environments is called venv. venv will usually install the most recent version of Python that you have available. If you have multiple versions of Python on your system, you can select a speciﬁc Python version by running python3 or whichever version you want.\\n\\nTo create a virtual environment, decide upon a directory where you want to place it, and run the venv module as a script with the directory path:\\n\\npython3 -m venv tutorial-env\\n\\nThis will create the tutorial-env directory if it doesn’t exist, and also create directories inside it containing a copy of the Python interpreter, the standard library, and various supporting ﬁles.\\n\\nOnce you’ve created a virtual environment, you may activate it.\\n\\nOn Windows, run:\\n\\ntutorial-env\\\\Scripts\\\\activate.bat\\n\\nOn Unix or MacOS, run:\\n\\nsource tutorial-env/bin/activate\\n\\n97\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n(This script is written for the bash shell. If you use the csh or fish shells, there are alternate activate.csh and activate.fish scripts you should use instead.)\\n\\nActivating the virtual environment will change your shell’s prompt to show what virtual environment you’re using, and modify the environment so that running python will get you that particular version and instal- lation of Python. For example:\\n\\n$ source ~/envs/tutorial-env/bin/activate (tutorial-env) $ python Python 3.5.1 (default, May\\n\\n6 2016, 10:59:36)\\n\\n...\\n\\n>>> import sys >>> sys.path [\\'\\', \\'/usr/local/lib/python35.zip\\', ..., \\'~/envs/tutorial-env/lib/python3.5/site-packages\\'] >>>\\n\\n12.3 Managing Packages with pip\\n\\nYou can install, upgrade, and remove packages using a program called pip. By default pip will install packages from the Python Package Index, <https://pypi.org>. You can browse the Python Package Index by going to it in your web browser, or you can use pip’s limited search feature:\\n\\n(tutorial-env) $ pip search astronomy skyfield gary novas astroobs PyAstronomy ...\\n\\nElegant astronomy for Python - Galactic astronomy and gravitational dynamics. - The United States Naval Observatory NOVAS astronomy library - Provides astronomy ephemeris to plan telescope observations - A collection of astronomy related tools for Python.\\n\\npip has a number of subcommands: “search”, “install”, “uninstall”, “freeze”, etc. (Consult the installing- index guide for complete documentation for pip.)\\n\\nYou can install the latest version of a package by specifying a package’s name:\\n\\n(tutorial-env) $ pip install novas Collecting novas\\n\\nDownloading novas-3.1.1.3.tar.gz (136kB)\\n\\nInstalling collected packages: novas Running setup.py install for novas Successfully installed novas-3.1.1.3\\n\\nYou can also install a speciﬁc version of a package by giving the package name followed by == and the version number:\\n\\n(tutorial-env) $ pip install requests==2.6.0 Collecting requests==2.6.0\\n\\nUsing cached requests-2.6.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl\\n\\nInstalling collected packages: requests Successfully installed requests-2.6.0\\n\\nIf you re-run this command, pip will notice that the requested version is already installed and do nothing. You can supply a diﬀerent version number to get that version, or you can run pip install --upgrade to upgrade the package to the latest version:\\n\\n98\\n\\nChapter 12.

A common convention is to put this list in a requirements.txt ﬁle:\\n\\n(tutorial-env) $ pip freeze > requirements.txt (tutorial-env) $ cat requirements.txt novas==3.1.1.3 numpy==1.9.2 requests==2.7.0\\n\\nThe requirements.txt can then be committed to version control and shipped as part of an application. Users can then install all the necessary packages with install -r:\\n\\n(tutorial-env) $ pip install -r requirements.txt Collecting novas==3.1.1.3 (from -r requirements.txt (line 1))\\n\\n...\\n\\nCollecting numpy==1.9.2 (from -r requirements.txt (line 2))\\n\\n...\\n\\nCollecting requests==2.7.0 (from -r requirements.txt (line 3))\\n\\n...\\n\\nInstalling collected packages: novas, numpy, requests\\n\\nRunning setup.py install for novas\\n\\nSuccessfully installed novas-3.1.1.3 numpy-1.9.2 requests-2.7.0\\n\\n12.3.

The FAQ answers many of the questions that come up again and again, and may already contain the solution for your problem.\\n\\n102\\n\\nChapter 13. What Now?\\n\\nCHAPTER\\n\\nFOURTEEN\\n\\nINTERACTIVE INPUT EDITING AND HISTORY SUBSTITUTION\\n\\nSome versions of the Python interpreter support editing of the current input line and history substitution, similar to facilities found in the Korn shell and the GNU Bash shell. This is implemented using the GNU Readline library, which supports various styles of editing. This library has its own documentation which we won’t duplicate here.\\n\\n14.1 Tab Completion and History Editing\\n\\nCompletion of variable and module names is automatically enabled at interpreter startup so that the Tab key invokes the completion function; it looks at Python statement names, the current local variables, and the available module names. For dotted expressions such as string.a, it will evaluate the expression up to the ﬁnal \\'.\\' and then suggest completions from the attributes of the resulting object. Note that this may execute application-deﬁned code if an object with a __getattr__() method is part of the expression. The default conﬁguration also saves your history into a ﬁle named .python_history in your user directory. The history will be available again during the next interactive interpreter session.\\n\\n14.2 Alternatives to the Interactive Interpreter\\n\\nThis facility is an enormous step forward compared to earlier versions of the interpreter; however, some wishes are left: It would be nice if the proper indentation were suggested on continuation lines (the parser knows if an indent token is required next). The completion mechanism might use the interpreter’s symbol table. A command to check (or even suggest) matching parentheses, quotes, etc., would also be useful.\\n\\nOne alternative enhanced interactive interpreter that has been around for quite some time is IPython, which features tab completion, object exploration and advanced history management. It can also be thoroughly customized and embedded into other applications. Another similar enhanced interactive environment is bpython.\\n\\n103\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n104\\n\\nChapter 14.\\n\\nInteractive Input Editing and History Substitution\\n\\nCHAPTER\\n\\nFIFTEEN\\n\\nFLOATING POINT ARITHMETIC: ISSUES AND LIMITATIONS\\n\\nFloating-point numbers are represented in computer hardware as base 2 (binary) fractions. For example, the decimal fraction\\n\\n0.125\\n\\nhas value 1/10 + 2/100 + 5/1000, and in the same way the binary fraction\\n\\n0.001\\n\\nhas value 0/2 + 0/4 + 1/8. These two fractions have identical values, the only real diﬀerence being that the ﬁrst is written in base 10 fractional notation, and the second in base 2.\\n\\nUnfortunately, most decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly as binary fractions. A consequence is that, in general, the decimal ﬂoating-point numbers you enter are only approximated by the binary ﬂoating- point numbers actually stored in the machine.\\n\\nThe problem is easier to understand at ﬁrst in base 10. Consider the fraction 1/3. You can approximate that as a base 10 fraction:\\n\\n0.3\\n\\nor, better,\\n\\n0.33\\n\\nor, better,\\n\\n0.333\\n\\nand so on. No matter how many digits you’re willing to write down, the result will never be exactly 1/3, but will be an increasingly better approximation of 1/3.\\n\\nIn the same way, no matter how many base 2 digits you’re willing to use, the decimal value 0.1 cannot be represented exactly as a base 2 fraction. In base 2, 1/10 is the inﬁnitely repeating fraction\\n\\n0.0001100110011001100110011001100110011001100110011...\\n\\nStop at any ﬁnite number of bits, and you get an approximation. On most machines today, ﬂoats are approximated using a binary fraction with the numerator using the ﬁrst 53 bits starting with the most signiﬁcant bit and with the denominator as a power of two. In the case of 1/10, the binary fraction is 3602879701896397 / 2 ** 55 which is close to but not exactly equal to the true value of 1/10.\\n\\nMany users are not aware of the approximation because of the way values are displayed. Python only prints a decimal approximation to the true decimal value of the binary approximation stored by the machine. On most machines, if Python were to print the true decimal value of the binary approximation stored for 0.1, it would have to display\\n\\n105\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n>>> 0.1 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625\\n\\nThat is more digits than most people ﬁnd useful, so Python keeps the number of digits manageable by displaying a rounded value instead\\n\\n>>> 1 / 10 0.1\\n\\nJust remember, even though the printed result looks like the exact value of 1/10, the actual stored value is the nearest representable binary fraction.\\n\\nInterestingly, proximate binary fraction. 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625 3602879701896397 / 2 ** 55. any one of them could be displayed while still preserving the invariant eval(repr(x)) == x.\\n\\nthere\\n\\nare many diﬀerent decimal numbers example,\\n\\nap- the numbers 0.1 and 0.10000000000000001 and by Since all of these decimal values share the same approximation,\\n\\nshare\\n\\nthat\\n\\nsame nearest\\n\\nthe\\n\\nFor\\n\\nare\\n\\nall\\n\\napproximated\\n\\nHistorically, the Python prompt and built-in repr() function would choose the one with 17 signiﬁcant digits, 0.10000000000000001. Starting with Python 3.1, Python (on most systems) is now able to choose the shortest of these and simply display 0.1.\\n\\nNote that this is in the very nature of binary ﬂoating-point: this is not a bug in Python, and it is not a bug in your code either. You’ll see the same kind of thing in all languages that support your hardware’s ﬂoating-point arithmetic (although some languages may not display the diﬀerence by default, or in all output modes).\\n\\nFor more pleasant output, you may wish to use string formatting to produce a limited number of signiﬁcant digits:\\n\\n>>> format(math.pi, \\'.12g\\') # give 12 significant digits \\'3.14159265359\\'\\n\\n>>> format(math.pi, \\'.2f\\') \\'3.14\\'\\n\\n# give 2 digits after the point\\n\\n>>> repr(math.pi) \\'3.141592653589793\\'\\n\\nIt’s important to realize that this is, in a real sense, an illusion: you’re simply rounding the display of the true machine value.\\n\\nOne illusion may beget another. For example, since 0.1 is not exactly 1/10, summing three values of 0.1 may not yield exactly 0.3, either:\\n\\n>>> .1 + .1 + .1 == .3 False\\n\\nAlso, since the 0.1 cannot get any closer to the exact value of 1/10 and 0.3 cannot get any closer to the exact value of 3/10, then pre-rounding with round() function cannot help:\\n\\n>>> round(.1, 1) + round(.1, 1) + round(.1, 1) == round(.3, 1) False\\n\\nThough the numbers cannot be made closer to their intended exact values, the round() function can be useful for post-rounding so that results with inexact values become comparable to one another:\\n\\n>>> round(.1 + .1 + .1, 10) == round(.3, 10) True\\n\\n106\\n\\nChapter 15. Floating Point Arithmetic: Issues and Limitations\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nBinary ﬂoating-point arithmetic holds many surprises like this. The problem with “0.1” is explained in precise detail below, in the “Representation Error” section. See The Perils of Floating Point for a more complete account of other common surprises.\\n\\nAs that says near the end, “there are no easy answers.” Still, don’t be unduly wary of ﬂoating-point! The errors in Python ﬂoat operations are inherited from the ﬂoating-point hardware, and on most machines are on the order of no more than 1 part in 2**53 per operation. That’s more than adequate for most tasks, but you do need to keep in mind that it’s not decimal arithmetic and that every ﬂoat operation can suﬀer a new rounding error.\\n\\nWhile pathological cases do exist, for most casual use of ﬂoating-point arithmetic you’ll see the result you expect in the end if you simply round the display of your ﬁnal results to the number of decimal digits you expect. str() usually suﬃces, and for ﬁner control see the str.format() method’s format speciﬁers in formatstrings.\\n\\nFor use cases which require exact decimal representation, try using the decimal module which implements decimal arithmetic suitable for accounting applications and high-precision applications.\\n\\nAnother form of exact arithmetic is supported by the fractions module which implements arithmetic based on rational numbers (so the numbers like 1/3 can be represented exactly).\\n\\nIf you are a heavy user of ﬂoating point operations you should take a look at the Numerical Python package and many other packages for mathematical and statistical operations supplied by the SciPy project. See <https://scipy.org>.\\n\\nPython provides tools that may help on those rare occasions when you really do want to know the exact value of a ﬂoat. The float.as_integer_ratio() method expresses the value of a ﬂoat as a fraction:\\n\\n>>> x = 3.14159 >>> x.as_integer_ratio() (3537115888337719, 1125899906842624)\\n\\nSince the ratio is exact, it can be used to losslessly recreate the original value:\\n\\n>>> x == 3537115888337719 / 1125899906842624 True\\n\\nThe float.hex() method expresses a ﬂoat in hexadecimal (base 16), again giving the exact value stored by your computer:\\n\\n>>> x.hex() \\'0x1.921f9f01b866ep+1\\'\\n\\nThis precise hexadecimal representation can be used to reconstruct the ﬂoat value exactly:\\n\\n>>> x == float.fromhex(\\'0x1.921f9f01b866ep+1\\') True\\n\\nSince the representation is exact, it is useful for reliably porting values across diﬀerent versions of Python (platform independence) and exchanging data with other languages that support the same format (such as Java and C99).\\n\\nAnother helpful tool is the math.fsum() function which helps mitigate loss-of-precision during summation. It tracks “lost digits” as values are added onto a running total. That can make a diﬀerence in overall accuracy so that the errors do not accumulate to the point where they aﬀect the ﬁnal total:\\n\\n>>> sum([0.1] * 10) == 1.0 False >>> math.fsum([0.1] * 10) == 1.0 True\\n\\n107\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n15.1 Representation Error\\n\\nThis section explains the “0.1” example in detail, and shows how you can perform an exact analysis of cases like this yourself. Basic familiarity with binary ﬂoating-point representation is assumed.\\n\\nRepresentation error refers to the fact that some (most, actually) decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly as binary (base 2) fractions. This is the chief reason why Python (or Perl, C, C++, Java, Fortran, and many others) often won’t display the exact decimal number you expect.\\n\\nWhy is that? 1/10 is not exactly representable as a binary fraction. Almost all machines today (November 2000) use IEEE-754 ﬂoating point arithmetic, and almost all platforms map Python ﬂoats to IEEE-754 “double precision”. 754 doubles contain 53 bits of precision, so on input the computer strives to convert 0.1 to the closest fraction it can of the form J/2**N where J is an integer containing exactly 53 bits. Rewriting\\n\\n1 / 10 ~= J / (2**N)\\n\\nas\\n\\nJ ~= 2**N / 10\\n\\nand recalling that J has exactly 53 bits (is >= 2**52 but < 2**53), the best value for N is 56:\\n\\n>>> 2**52 <= 2**56 // 10 True\\n\\n< 2**53\\n\\nThat is, 56 is the only value for N that leaves J with exactly 53 bits. The best possible value for J is then that quotient rounded:\\n\\n>>> q, r = divmod(2**56, 10) >>> r 6\\n\\nSince the remainder is more than half of 10, the best approximation is obtained by rounding up:\\n\\n>>> q+1 7205759403792794\\n\\nTherefore the best possible approximation to 1/10 in 754 double precision is:\\n\\n7205759403792794 / 2 ** 56\\n\\nDividing both the numerator and denominator by two reduces the fraction to:\\n\\n3602879701896397 / 2 ** 55\\n\\nNote that since we rounded up, this is actually a little bit larger than 1/10; if we had not rounded up, the quotient would have been a little bit smaller than 1/10. But in no case can it be exactly 1/10!\\n\\nSo the computer never “sees” 1/10: what it sees is the exact fraction given above, the best 754 double approximation it can get:\\n\\n>>> 0.1 * 2 ** 55 3602879701896397.0\\n\\nIf we multiply that fraction by 10**55, we can see the value out to 55 decimal digits:\\n\\n>>> 3602879701896397 * 10 ** 55 // 2 ** 55 1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625\\n\\n108\\n\\nChapter 15.

Floating Point Arithmetic: Issues and Limitations\\n\\nCHAPTER\\n\\nSIXTEEN\\n\\nAPPENDIX\\n\\n16.1 Interactive Mode\\n\\n16.1.1 Error Handling\\n\\nWhen an error occurs, the interpreter prints an error message and a stack trace. In interactive mode, it then returns to the primary prompt; when input came from a ﬁle, it exits with a nonzero exit status after printing the stack trace. (Exceptions handled by an except clause in a try statement are not errors in this context.) Some errors are unconditionally fatal and cause an exit with a nonzero exit; this applies to internal inconsistencies and some cases of running out of memory. All error messages are written to the standard error stream; normal output from executed commands is written to standard output.\\n\\nTyping the interrupt character (usually Control-C or Delete) to the primary or secondary prompt cancels the input and returns to the primary prompt.1 Typing an interrupt while a command is executing raises the KeyboardInterrupt exception, which may be handled by a try statement.\\n\\n16.1.2 Executable Python Scripts\\n\\nOn BSD’ish Unix systems, Python scripts can be made directly executable, like shell scripts, by putting the line\\n\\n#!/usr/bin/env python3.5\\n\\n(assuming that the interpreter is on the user’s PATH) at the beginning of the script and giving the ﬁle an executable mode. The #! must be the ﬁrst two characters of the ﬁle. On some platforms, this ﬁrst line must end with a Unix-style line ending (\\'\\\\n\\'), not a Windows (\\'\\\\r\\\\n\\') line ending. Note that the hash, or pound, character, \\'#\\', is used to start a comment in Python.\\n\\nThe script can be given an executable mode, or permission, using the chmod command.\\n\\n$ chmod +x myscript.py\\n\\nOn Windows systems, there is no notion of an “executable mode”. The Python installer automatically associates .py ﬁles with python.exe so that a double-click on a Python ﬁle will run it as a script. The extension can also be .pyw, in that case, the console window that normally appears is suppressed.\\n\\n16.1.3 The Interactive Startup File\\n\\nWhen you use Python interactively, it is frequently handy to have some standard commands executed every time the interpreter is started. You can do this by setting an environment variable named PYTHONSTARTUP\\n\\n1 A problem with the GNU Readline package may prevent this.\\n\\n111\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nto the name of a ﬁle containing your start-up commands. This is similar to the .profile feature of the Unix shells.\\n\\nThis ﬁle is only read in interactive sessions, not when Python reads commands from a script, and not when /dev/tty is given as the explicit source of commands (which otherwise behaves like an interactive session). It is executed in the same namespace where interactive commands are executed, so that objects that it deﬁnes or imports can be used without qualiﬁcation in the interactive session. You can also change the prompts sys.ps1 and sys.ps2 in this ﬁle.\\n\\nIf you want to read an additional start-up ﬁle from the current directory, you can program this in the global start-up ﬁle using code like if os.path.isfile(\\'.pythonrc.py\\'): exec(open(\\'.pythonrc.py\\'). read()). If you want to use the startup ﬁle in a script, you must do this explicitly in the script:\\n\\nimport os filename = os.environ.get(\\'PYTHONSTARTUP\\') if filename and os.path.isfile(filename):\\n\\nwith open(filename) as fobj:\\n\\nstartup_file = fobj.read()\\n\\nexec(startup_file)\\n\\n16.1.4 The Customization Modules\\n\\nPython provides two hooks to let you customize it: sitecustomize and usercustomize. To see how it works, you need ﬁrst to ﬁnd the location of your user site-packages directory. Start Python and run this code:\\n\\n>>> import site >>> site.getusersitepackages() \\'/home/user/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages\\'\\n\\nNow you can create a ﬁle named usercustomize.py in that directory and put anything you want in it. It will aﬀect every invocation of Python, unless it is started with the -s option to disable the automatic import.\\n\\nsitecustomize works in the same way, but is typically created by an administrator of the computer in the global site-packages directory, and is imported before usercustomize. See the documentation of the site module for more details.\\n\\n112\\n\\nChapter 16. Appendix\\n\\nAPPENDIX\\n\\nA\\n\\nGLOSSARY\\n\\n>>> The default Python prompt of the interactive shell. Often seen for code examples which can be executed\\n\\ninteractively in the interpreter.\\n\\n... The default Python prompt of the interactive shell when entering code for an indented code block, when within a pair of matching left and right delimiters (parentheses, square brackets, curly braces or triple quotes), or after specifying a decorator.\\n\\n2to3 A tool that tries to convert Python 2.x code to Python 3.x code by handling most of the incompati-\\n\\nbilities which can be detected by parsing the source and traversing the parse tree.\\n\\n2to3 is available in the standard library as lib2to3; a standalone entry point is provided as Tools/ scripts/2to3. See 2to3-reference.\\n\\nabstract base class Abstract base classes complement duck-typing by providing a way to deﬁne interfaces when other techniques like hasattr() would be clumsy or subtly wrong (for example with magic methods). ABCs introduce virtual subclasses, which are classes that don’t inherit from a class but are still recognized by isinstance() and issubclass(); see the abc module documentation. Python comes with many built-in ABCs for data structures (in the collections.abc module), numbers (in the numbers module), streams (in the io module), import ﬁnders and loaders (in the importlib.abc module). You can create your own ABCs with the abc module.\\n\\nannotation A label associated with a variable, a class attribute or a function parameter or return value,\\n\\nused by convention as a type hint.\\n\\nAnnotations of local variables cannot be accessed at runtime, but annotations of global variables, class attributes, and functions are stored in the __annotations__ special attribute of modules, classes, and functions, respectively.\\n\\nSee variable annotation, function annotation, PEP 484 and PEP 526, which describe this function- ality.\\n\\nargument A value passed to a function (or method) when calling the function. There are two kinds of\\n\\nargument:\\n\\nkeyword argument: an argument preceded by an identiﬁer (e.g. name=) in a function call or passed as a value in a dictionary preceded by **. For example, 3 and 5 are both keyword arguments in the following calls to complex():\\n\\ncomplex(real=3, imag=5) complex(**{\\'real\\': 3, \\'imag\\': 5})\\n\\npositional argument: an argument that is not a keyword argument. Positional arguments can appear at the beginning of an argument list and/or be passed as elements of an iterable preceded by *. For example, 3 and 5 are both positional arguments in the following calls:\\n\\ncomplex(3, 5) complex(*(3, 5))\\n\\n113\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nArguments are assigned to the named local variables in a function body. See the calls section for the rules governing this assignment. Syntactically, any expression can be used to represent an argument; the evaluated value is assigned to the local variable.\\n\\nSee also the parameter glossary entry, the FAQ question on the diﬀerence between arguments and parameters, and PEP 362.\\n\\nasynchronous context manager An object which controls the environment seen in an async with state-\\n\\nment by deﬁning __aenter__() and __aexit__() methods. Introduced by PEP 492.\\n\\nasynchronous generator A function which returns an asynchronous generator iterator. It looks like a coroutine function deﬁned with async def except that it contains yield expressions for producing a series of values usable in an async for loop.\\n\\nUsually refers to a asynchronous generator function, but may refer to an asynchronous generator iterator in some contexts. In cases where the intended meaning isn’t clear, using the full terms avoids ambiguity.\\n\\nAn asynchronous generator function may contain await expressions as well as async for, and async with statements.\\n\\nasynchronous generator iterator An object created by a asynchronous generator function.\\n\\nThis is an asynchronous iterator which when called using the __anext__() method returns an awaitable object which will execute that the body of the asynchronous generator function until the next yield expression.\\n\\nEach yield temporarily suspends processing, remembering the location execution state (including local variables and pending try-statements). When the asynchronous generator iterator eﬀectively resumes with another awaitable returned by __anext__(), it picks up where it left oﬀ. See PEP 492 and PEP 525.\\n\\nasynchronous iterable An object, that can be used in an async for statement. Must return an asyn-\\n\\nchronous iterator from its __aiter__() method. Introduced by PEP 492.\\n\\nasynchronous iterator An object\\n\\nimplements the __aiter__() and __anext__() methods. __anext__ must return an awaitable object. async for resolves the awaitables returned by an asyn- chronous iterator’s __anext__() method until it raises a StopAsyncIteration exception. Introduced by PEP 492.\\n\\nthat\\n\\nattribute A value associated with an object which is referenced by name using dotted expressions. For\\n\\nexample, if an object o has an attribute a it would be referenced as o.a.\\n\\nawaitable An object that can be used in an await expression. Can be a coroutine or an object with an\\n\\n__await__() method. See also PEP 492.\\n\\nBDFL Benevolent Dictator For Life, a.k.a. Guido van Rossum, Python’s creator.\\n\\nbinary ﬁle A ﬁle object able to read and write bytes-like objects. Examples of binary ﬁles are ﬁles opened in binary mode (\\'rb\\', \\'wb\\' or \\'rb+\\'), sys.stdin.buffer, sys.stdout.buffer, and instances of io.BytesIO and gzip.GzipFile.\\n\\nSee also text ﬁle for a ﬁle object able to read and write str objects.\\n\\nbytes-like object An object that supports the buﬀerobjects and can export a C-contiguous buﬀer. This includes all bytes, bytearray, and array.array objects, as well as many common memoryview ob- jects. Bytes-like objects can be used for various operations that work with binary data; these include compression, saving to a binary ﬁle, and sending over a socket.\\n\\nSome operations need the binary data to be mutable. The documentation often refers to these as “read- write bytes-like objects”. Example mutable buﬀer objects include bytearray and a memoryview of a bytearray. Other operations require the binary data to be stored in immutable objects (“read-only bytes-like objects”); examples of these include bytes and a memoryview of a bytes object.\\n\\n114\\n\\nAppendix A. Glossary\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nbytecode Python source code is compiled into bytecode, the internal representation of a Python program in the CPython interpreter. The bytecode is also cached in .pyc ﬁles so that executing the same ﬁle is faster the second time (recompilation from source to bytecode can be avoided). This “intermediate language” is said to run on a virtual machine that executes the machine code corresponding to each bytecode. Do note that bytecodes are not expected to work between diﬀerent Python virtual machines, nor to be stable between Python releases.\\n\\nA list of bytecode instructions can be found in the documentation for the dis module.\\n\\nclass A template for creating user-deﬁned objects. Class deﬁnitions normally contain method deﬁnitions\\n\\nwhich operate on instances of the class.\\n\\nclass variable A variable deﬁned in a class and intended to be modiﬁed only at class level (i.e., not in an\\n\\ninstance of the class).\\n\\ncoercion The implicit conversion of an instance of one type to another during an operation which involves two arguments of the same type. For example, int(3.15) converts the ﬂoating point number to the integer 3, but in 3+4.5, each argument is of a diﬀerent type (one int, one ﬂoat), and both must be converted to the same type before they can be added or it will raise a TypeError. Without coercion, all arguments of even compatible types would have to be normalized to the same value by the programmer, e.g., float(3)+4.5 rather than just 3+4.5.\\n\\ncomplex number An extension of the familiar real number system in which all numbers are expressed as a sum of a real part and an imaginary part. Imaginary numbers are real multiples of the imaginary unit (the square root of -1), often written i in mathematics or j in engineering. Python has built-in support for complex numbers, which are written with this latter notation; the imaginary part is written with a j suﬃx, e.g., 3+1j. To get access to complex equivalents of the math module, use cmath. Use of complex numbers is a fairly advanced mathematical feature. If you’re not aware of a need for them, it’s almost certain you can safely ignore them.\\n\\ncontext manager An object which controls the environment seen in a with statement by deﬁning\\n\\n__enter__() and __exit__() methods. See PEP 343.\\n\\ncontiguous A buﬀer is considered contiguous exactly if it is either C-contiguous or Fortran contiguous. In one-dimensional arrays, the items must Zero-dimensional buﬀers are C and Fortran contiguous. be laid out in memory next to each other, in order of increasing indexes starting from zero. In multidimensional C-contiguous arrays, the last index varies the fastest when visiting items in order of memory address. However, in Fortran contiguous arrays, the ﬁrst index varies the fastest.\\n\\ncoroutine Coroutines is a more generalized form of subroutines. Subroutines are entered at one point and exited at another point. Coroutines can be entered, exited, and resumed at many diﬀerent points. They can be implemented with the async def statement. See also PEP 492.\\n\\ncoroutine function A function which returns a coroutine object. A coroutine function may be deﬁned with the async def statement, and may contain await, async for, and async with keywords. These were introduced by PEP 492.\\n\\nCPython The canonical\\n\\nimplementation of the Python programming language, as distributed on python.org. The term “CPython” is used when necessary to distinguish this implementation from others such as Jython or IronPython.\\n\\ndecorator A function returning another function, usually applied as a function transformation using the @wrapper syntax. Common examples for decorators are classmethod() and staticmethod().\\n\\nThe decorator syntax is merely syntactic sugar, the following two function deﬁnitions are semantically equivalent:\\n\\ndef f(...): ...\\n\\nf = staticmethod(f)\\n\\n(continues on next page)\\n\\n115\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\n(continued from previous page)\\n\\n@staticmethod def f(...): ...\\n\\nThe same concept exists for classes, but is less commonly used there. See the documentation for function deﬁnitions and class deﬁnitions for more about decorators.\\n\\ndescriptor Any object which deﬁnes the methods __get__(), __set__(), or __delete__(). When a class attribute is a descriptor, its special binding behavior is triggered upon attribute lookup. Normally, using a.b to get, set or delete an attribute looks up the object named b in the class dictionary for a, but if b is a descriptor, the respective descriptor method gets called. Understanding descriptors is a key to a deep understanding of Python because they are the basis for many features including functions, methods, properties, class methods, static methods, and reference to super classes.\\n\\nFor more information about descriptors’ methods, see descriptors.\\n\\ndictionary An associative array, where arbitrary keys are mapped to values. The keys can be any object\\n\\nwith __hash__() and __eq__() methods. Called a hash in Perl.\\n\\ndictionary view The objects returned from dict.keys(), dict.values(), and dict.items() are called dictionary views. They provide a dynamic view on the dictionary’s entries, which means that when the dictionary changes, the view reﬂects these changes. To force the dictionary view to become a full list use list(dictview). See dict-views.\\n\\ndocstring A string literal which appears as the ﬁrst expression in a class, function or module. While ignored when the suite is executed, it is recognized by the compiler and put into the __doc__ attribute of the enclosing class, function or module. Since it is available via introspection, it is the canonical place for documentation of the object.\\n\\nduck-typing A programming style which does not look at an object’s type to determine if it has the right interface; instead, the method or attribute is simply called or used (“If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck.”) By emphasizing interfaces rather than speciﬁc types, well-designed code improves its ﬂexibility by allowing polymorphic substitution. Duck-typing avoids tests using type() or isinstance(). (Note, however, that duck-typing can be complemented with abstract base classes.) Instead, it typically employs hasattr() tests or EAFP programming.\\n\\nEAFP Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission. This common Python coding style assumes the existence of valid keys or attributes and catches exceptions if the assumption proves false. This clean and fast style is characterized by the presence of many try and except statements. The technique contrasts with the LBYL style common to many other languages such as C.\\n\\nexpression A piece of syntax which can be evaluated to some value.\\n\\nIn other words, an expression is an accumulation of expression elements like literals, names, attribute access, operators or function calls which all return a value. In contrast to many other languages, not all language constructs are expressions. There are also statements which cannot be used as expressions, such as if. Assignments are also statements, not expressions.\\n\\nextension module A module written in C or C++, using Python’s C API to interact with the core and\\n\\nwith user code.\\n\\nf-string String literals preﬁxed with \\'f\\' or \\'F\\' are commonly called “f-strings” which is short for formatted\\n\\nstring literals. See also PEP 498.\\n\\nﬁle object An object exposing a ﬁle-oriented API (with methods such as read() or write()) to an underly- ing resource. Depending on the way it was created, a ﬁle object can mediate access to a real on-disk ﬁle or to another type of storage or communication device (for example standard input/output, in-memory buﬀers, sockets, pipes, etc.). File objects are also called ﬁle-like objects or streams.\\n\\nThere are actually three categories of ﬁle objects: raw binary ﬁles, buﬀered binary ﬁles and text ﬁles. Their interfaces are deﬁned in the io module. The canonical way to create a ﬁle object is by using the\\n\\n116\\n\\nAppendix A. Glossary\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nopen() function.\\n\\nﬁle-like object A synonym for ﬁle object.\\n\\nﬁnder An object that tries to ﬁnd the loader for a module that is being imported.\\n\\nSince Python 3.3, there are two types of ﬁnder: meta path ﬁnders for use with sys.meta_path, and path entry ﬁnders for use with sys.path_hooks.\\n\\nSee PEP 302, PEP 420 and PEP 451 for much more detail.\\n\\nﬂoor division Mathematical division that rounds down to nearest integer. The ﬂoor division operator is //. For example, the expression 11 // 4 evaluates to 2 in contrast to the 2.75 returned by ﬂoat true division. Note that (-11) // 4 is -3 because that is -2.75 rounded downward. See PEP 238.\\n\\nfunction A series of statements which returns some value to a caller. It can also be passed zero or more arguments which may be used in the execution of the body. See also parameter, method, and the function section.\\n\\nfunction annotation An annotation of a function parameter or return value.\\n\\nFunction annotations are usually used for type hints: for example this function is expected to take two int arguments and is also expected to have an int return value:\\n\\ndef sum_two_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:\\n\\nreturn a + b\\n\\nFunction annotation syntax is explained in section function.\\n\\nSee variable annotation and PEP 484, which describe this functionality.\\n\\n__future__ A pseudo-module which programmers can use to enable new language features which are\\n\\nnot compatible with the current interpreter.\\n\\nBy importing the __future__ module and evaluating its variables, you can see when a new feature was ﬁrst added to the language and when it becomes the default:\\n\\n>>> import __future__ >>> __future__.division _Feature((2, 2, 0, \\'alpha\\', 2), (3, 0, 0, \\'alpha\\', 0), 8192)\\n\\ngarbage collection The process of freeing memory when it is not used anymore. Python performs garbage collection via reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector that is able to detect and break reference cycles. The garbage collector can be controlled using the gc module.\\n\\ngenerator A function which returns a generator iterator. It looks like a normal function except that it contains yield expressions for producing a series of values usable in a for-loop or that can be retrieved one at a time with the next() function.\\n\\nUsually refers to a generator function, but may refer to a generator iterator in some contexts. In cases where the intended meaning isn’t clear, using the full terms avoids ambiguity.\\n\\ngenerator iterator An object created by a generator function.\\n\\nEach yield temporarily suspends processing, remembering the location execution state (including local variables and pending try-statements). When the generator iterator resumes, it picks up where it left oﬀ (in contrast to functions which start fresh on every invocation).\\n\\ngenerator expression An expression that returns an iterator. It looks like a normal expression followed by a for expression deﬁning a loop variable, range, and an optional if expression. The combined expression generates values for an enclosing function:\\n\\n>>> sum(i*i for i in range(10)) 285\\n\\n# sum of squares 0, 1, 4, ... 81\\n\\n117\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\ngeneric function A function composed of multiple functions implementing the same operation for diﬀerent\\n\\ntypes. Which implementation should be used during a call is determined by the dispatch algorithm.\\n\\nSee also the single dispatch glossary entry, the functools.singledispatch() decorator, and PEP 443.\\n\\nGIL See global interpreter lock.\\n\\nglobal interpreter lock The mechanism used by the CPython interpreter to assure that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time. This simpliﬁes the CPython implementation by making the object model (including critical built-in types such as dict) implicitly safe against concurrent access. Locking the entire interpreter makes it easier for the interpreter to be multi-threaded, at the expense of much of the parallelism aﬀorded by multi-processor machines.\\n\\nHowever, some extension modules, either standard or third-party, are designed so as to release the GIL when doing computationally-intensive tasks such as compression or hashing. Also, the GIL is always released when doing I/O.\\n\\nPast eﬀorts to create a “free-threaded” interpreter (one which locks shared data at a much ﬁner granularity) have not been successful because performance suﬀered in the common single-processor case. It is believed that overcoming this performance issue would make the implementation much more complicated and therefore costlier to maintain.\\n\\nhash-based pyc A bytecode cache ﬁle that uses the hash rather than the last-modiﬁed time of the corre-\\n\\nsponding source ﬁle to determine its validity. See pyc-invalidation.\\n\\nhashable An object is hashable if it has a hash value which never changes during its lifetime (it needs a __hash__() method), and can be compared to other objects (it needs an __eq__() method). Hashable objects which compare equal must have the same hash value.\\n\\nHashability makes an object usable as a dictionary key and a set member, because these data structures use the hash value internally.\\n\\nAll of Python’s immutable built-in objects are hashable; mutable containers (such as lists or dictio- naries) are not. Objects which are instances of user-deﬁned classes are hashable by default. They all compare unequal (except with themselves), and their hash value is derived from their id().\\n\\nIDLE An Integrated Development Environment for Python. IDLE is a basic editor and interpreter envi-\\n\\nronment which ships with the standard distribution of Python.\\n\\nimmutable An object with a ﬁxed value. Immutable objects include numbers, strings and tuples. Such an object cannot be altered. A new object has to be created if a diﬀerent value has to be stored. They play an important role in places where a constant hash value is needed, for example as a key in a dictionary.\\n\\nimport path A list of locations (or path entries) that are searched by the path based ﬁnder for modules to import. During import, this list of locations usually comes from sys.path, but for subpackages it may also come from the parent package’s __path__ attribute.\\n\\nimporting The process by which Python code in one module is made available to Python code in another\\n\\nmodule.\\n\\nimporter An object that both ﬁnds and loads a module; both a ﬁnder and loader object.\\n\\ninteractive Python has an interactive interpreter which means you can enter statements and expressions at the interpreter prompt, immediately execute them and see their results. Just launch python with no arguments (possibly by selecting it from your computer’s main menu). It is a very powerful way to test out new ideas or inspect modules and packages (remember help(x)).\\n\\ninterpreted Python is an interpreted language, as opposed to a compiled one, though the distinction can be blurry because of the presence of the bytecode compiler. This means that source ﬁles can be run directly without explicitly creating an executable which is then run. Interpreted languages typically\\n\\n118\\n\\nAppendix A. Glossary\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nhave a shorter development/debug cycle than compiled ones, though their programs generally also run more slowly. See also interactive.\\n\\ninterpreter shutdown When asked to shut down, the Python interpreter enters a special phase where it gradually releases all allocated resources, such as modules and various critical internal structures. It also makes several calls to the garbage collector. This can trigger the execution of code in user-deﬁned destructors or weakref callbacks. Code executed during the shutdown phase can encounter various exceptions as the resources it relies on may not function anymore (common examples are library modules or the warnings machinery).\\n\\nThe main reason for interpreter shutdown is that the __main__ module or the script being run has ﬁnished executing.\\n\\niterable An object capable of returning its members one at a time. Examples of iterables include all sequence types (such as list, str, and tuple) and some non-sequence types like dict, ﬁle objects, and objects of any classes you deﬁne with an __iter__() method or with a __getitem__() method that implements Sequence semantics.\\n\\nIterables can be used in a for loop and in many other places where a sequence is needed (zip(), map(), …). When an iterable object is passed as an argument to the built-in function iter(), it returns an iterator for the object. This iterator is good for one pass over the set of values. When using iterables, it is usually not necessary to call iter() or deal with iterator objects yourself. The for statement does that automatically for you, creating a temporary unnamed variable to hold the iterator for the duration of the loop. See also iterator, sequence, and generator.\\n\\niterator An object representing a stream of data. Repeated calls to the iterator’s __next__() method (or passing it to the built-in function next()) return successive items in the stream. When no more data are available a StopIteration exception is raised instead. At this point, the iterator object is exhausted and any further calls to its __next__() method just raise StopIteration again. Iterators are required to have an __iter__() method that returns the iterator object itself so every iterator is also iterable and may be used in most places where other iterables are accepted. One notable exception is code which attempts multiple iteration passes. A container object (such as a list) produces a fresh new iterator each time you pass it to the iter() function or use it in a for loop. Attempting this with an iterator will just return the same exhausted iterator object used in the previous iteration pass, making it appear like an empty container.\\n\\nMore information can be found in typeiter.\\n\\nkey function A key function or collation function is a callable that returns a value used for sorting or ordering. For example, locale.strxfrm() is used to produce a sort key that is aware of locale speciﬁc sort conventions.\\n\\nA number of tools in Python accept key functions to control how elements are ordered or grouped. They include min(), max(), sorted(), list.sort(), heapq.merge(), heapq.nsmallest(), heapq. nlargest(), and itertools.groupby().\\n\\nThere are several ways to create a key function. For example. the str.lower() method can serve as a key function for case insensitive sorts. Alternatively, a key function can be built from a lambda expression such as lambda r: (r[0], r[2]). Also, the operator module provides three key function constructors: attrgetter(), itemgetter(), and methodcaller(). See the Sorting HOW TO for examples of how to create and use key functions.\\n\\nkeyword argument See argument.\\n\\nlambda An anonymous inline function consisting of a single expression which is evaluated when the function\\n\\nis called. The syntax to create a lambda function is lambda [parameters]: expression\\n\\nLBYL Look before you leap. This coding style explicitly tests for pre-conditions before making calls or lookups. This style contrasts with the EAFP approach and is characterized by the presence of many if statements.\\n\\n119\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nIn a multi-threaded environment, the LBYL approach can risk introducing a race condition between “the looking” and “the leaping”. For example, the code, if key in mapping: return mapping[key] can fail if another thread removes key from mapping after the test, but before the lookup. This issue can be solved with locks or by using the EAFP approach.\\n\\nlist A built-in Python sequence. Despite its name it is more akin to an array in other languages than to a\\n\\nlinked list since access to elements is O(1).\\n\\nlist comprehension A compact way to process all or part of the elements in a sequence and return a list with the results. result = [\\'{:#04x}\\'.format(x) for x in range(256) if x % 2 == 0] generates a list of strings containing even hex numbers (0x..) in the range from 0 to 255. The if clause is optional. If omitted, all elements in range(256) are processed.\\n\\nloader An object that loads a module. It must deﬁne a method named load_module(). A loader is typically returned by a ﬁnder. See PEP 302 for details and importlib.abc.Loader for an abstract base class.\\n\\nmapping A container object that supports arbitrary key lookups and implements the methods speciﬁed in the Mapping or MutableMapping abstract base classes. Examples include dict, collections. defaultdict, collections.OrderedDict and collections.Counter.\\n\\nmeta path ﬁnder A ﬁnder returned by a search of sys.meta_path. Meta path ﬁnders are related to, but\\n\\ndiﬀerent from path entry ﬁnders.\\n\\nSee importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder for the methods that meta path ﬁnders implement.\\n\\nmetaclass The class of a class. Class deﬁnitions create a class name, a class dictionary, and a list of base classes. The metaclass is responsible for taking those three arguments and creating the class. Most object oriented programming languages provide a default implementation. What makes Python special is that it is possible to create custom metaclasses. Most users never need this tool, but when the need arises, metaclasses can provide powerful, elegant solutions. They have been used for logging attribute access, adding thread-safety, tracking object creation, implementing singletons, and many other tasks.\\n\\nMore information can be found in metaclasses.\\n\\nmethod A function which is deﬁned inside a class body. If called as an attribute of an instance of that class, the method will get the instance object as its ﬁrst argument (which is usually called self). See function and nested scope.\\n\\nmethod resolution order Method Resolution Order is the order in which base classes are searched for a member during lookup. See The Python 2.3 Method Resolution Order for details of the algorithm used by the Python interpreter since the 2.3 release.\\n\\nmodule An object that serves as an organizational unit of Python code. Modules have a namespace\\n\\ncontaining arbitrary Python objects. Modules are loaded into Python by the process of importing.\\n\\nSee also package.\\n\\nmodule spec A namespace containing the import-related information used to load a module. An instance\\n\\nof importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec.\\n\\nMRO See method resolution order.\\n\\nmutable Mutable objects can change their value but keep their id(). See also immutable.\\n\\nnamed tuple Any tuple-like class whose indexable elements are also accessible using named attributes (for example, time.localtime() returns a tuple-like object where the year is accessible either with an index such as t[0] or with a named attribute like t.tm_year).\\n\\nA named tuple can be a built-in type such as time.struct_time, or it can be created with a regular class deﬁnition. A full featured named tuple can also be created with the factory function collections. namedtuple(). The latter approach automatically provides extra features such as a self-documenting representation like Employee(name=\\'jones\\', title=\\'programmer\\').\\n\\n120\\n\\nAppendix A. Glossary\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nnamespace The place where a variable is stored. Namespaces are implemented as dictionaries. There are the local, global and built-in namespaces as well as nested namespaces in objects (in methods). Namespaces support modularity by preventing naming conﬂicts. For instance, the functions builtins. open and os.open() are distinguished by their namespaces. Namespaces also aid readability and maintainability by making it clear which module implements a function. For instance, writing random. seed() or itertools.islice() makes it clear that those functions are implemented by the random and itertools modules, respectively.\\n\\nnamespace package A PEP 420 package which serves only as a container for subpackages. Namespace packages may have no physical representation, and speciﬁcally are not like a regular package because they have no __init__.py ﬁle.\\n\\nSee also module.\\n\\nnested scope The ability to refer to a variable in an enclosing deﬁnition. For instance, a function deﬁned inside another function can refer to variables in the outer function. Note that nested scopes by default work only for reference and not for assignment. Local variables both read and write in the innermost scope. Likewise, global variables read and write to the global namespace. The nonlocal allows writing to outer scopes.\\n\\nnew-style class Old name for the ﬂavor of classes now used for all class objects. In earlier Python ver- sions, only new-style classes could use Python’s newer, versatile features like __slots__, descriptors, properties, __getattribute__(), class methods, and static methods.\\n\\nobject Any data with state (attributes or value) and deﬁned behavior (methods). Also the ultimate base\\n\\nclass of any new-style class.\\n\\npackage A Python module which can contain submodules or recursively, subpackages. Technically, a pack-\\n\\nage is a Python module with an __path__ attribute.\\n\\nSee also regular package and namespace package.\\n\\nparameter A named entity in a function (or method) deﬁnition that speciﬁes an argument (or in some\\n\\ncases, arguments) that the function can accept. There are ﬁve kinds of parameter:\\n\\npositional-or-keyword: speciﬁes an argument that can be passed either positionally or as a keyword argument. This is the default kind of parameter, for example foo and bar in the following:\\n\\ndef func(foo, bar=None): ...\\n\\npositional-only: speciﬁes an argument that can be supplied only by position. Python has no syntax for deﬁning positional-only parameters. However, some built-in functions have positional- only parameters (e.g. abs()).\\n\\nkeyword-only: speciﬁes an argument that can be supplied only by keyword. Keyword-only pa- rameters can be deﬁned by including a single var-positional parameter or bare * in the parameter list of the function deﬁnition before them, for example kw_only1 and kw_only2 in the following:\\n\\ndef func(arg, *, kw_only1, kw_only2): ...\\n\\nvar-positional: speciﬁes that an arbitrary sequence of positional arguments can be provided (in addition to any positional arguments already accepted by other parameters). Such a parameter can be deﬁned by prepending the parameter name with *, for example args in the following: def func(*args, **kwargs): ...\\n\\nvar-keyword: speciﬁes that arbitrarily many keyword arguments can be provided (in addition to any keyword arguments already accepted by other parameters). Such a parameter can be deﬁned by prepending the parameter name with **, for example kwargs in the example above.\\n\\nParameters can specify both optional and required arguments, as well as default values for some optional arguments.\\n\\n121\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nSee also the argument glossary entry, the FAQ question on the diﬀerence between arguments and parameters, the inspect.Parameter class, the function section, and PEP 362.\\n\\npath entry A single location on the import path which the path based ﬁnder consults to ﬁnd modules for\\n\\nimporting.\\n\\npath entry ﬁnder A ﬁnder returned by a callable on sys.path_hooks (i.e. a path entry hook) which knows\\n\\nhow to locate modules given a path entry.\\n\\nSee importlib.abc.PathEntryFinder for the methods that path entry ﬁnders implement.\\n\\npath entry hook A callable on the sys.path_hook list which returns a path entry ﬁnder if it knows how\\n\\nto ﬁnd modules on a speciﬁc path entry.\\n\\npath based ﬁnder One of the default meta path ﬁnders which searches an import path for modules.\\n\\npath-like object An object representing a ﬁle system path. A path-like object is either a str or bytes object representing a path, or an object implementing the os.PathLike protocol. An object that supports the os.PathLike protocol can be converted to a str or bytes ﬁle system path by calling the os.fspath() function; os.fsdecode() and os.fsencode() can be used to guarantee a str or bytes result instead, respectively. Introduced by PEP 519.\\n\\nPEP Python Enhancement Proposal. A PEP is a design document providing information to the Python community, or describing a new feature for Python or its processes or environment. PEPs should provide a concise technical speciﬁcation and a rationale for proposed features.\\n\\nPEPs are intended to be the primary mechanisms for proposing major new features, for collecting com- munity input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Python. The PEP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.\\n\\nSee PEP 1.\\n\\nportion A set of ﬁles in a single directory (possibly stored in a zip ﬁle) that contribute to a namespace\\n\\npackage, as deﬁned in PEP 420.\\n\\npositional argument See argument.\\n\\nprovisional API A provisional API is one which has been deliberately excluded from the standard library’s backwards compatibility guarantees. While major changes to such interfaces are not expected, as long as they are marked provisional, backwards incompatible changes (up to and including removal of the interface) may occur if deemed necessary by core developers. Such changes will not be made gratuitously – they will occur only if serious fundamental ﬂaws are uncovered that were missed prior to the inclusion of the API.\\n\\nEven for provisional APIs, backwards incompatible changes are seen as a “solution of last resort” - every attempt will still be made to ﬁnd a backwards compatible resolution to any identiﬁed problems.\\n\\nThis process allows the standard library to continue to evolve over time, without locking in problematic design errors for extended periods of time. See PEP 411 for more details.\\n\\nprovisional package See provisional API.\\n\\nPython 3000 Nickname for the Python 3.x release line (coined long ago when the release of version 3 was\\n\\nsomething in the distant future.) This is also abbreviated “Py3k”.\\n\\nPythonic An idea or piece of code which closely follows the most common idioms of the Python language, rather than implementing code using concepts common to other languages. For example, a common idiom in Python is to loop over all elements of an iterable using a for statement. Many other languages don’t have this type of construct, so people unfamiliar with Python sometimes use a numerical counter instead:\\n\\nfor i in range(len(food)):\\n\\nprint(food[i])\\n\\n122\\n\\nAppendix A. Glossary\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nAs opposed to the cleaner, Pythonic method:\\n\\nfor piece in food:\\n\\nprint(piece)\\n\\nqualiﬁed name A dotted name showing the “path” from a module’s global scope to a class, function or method deﬁned in that module, as deﬁned in PEP 3155. For top-level functions and classes, the qualiﬁed name is the same as the object’s name:\\n\\n>>> class C: ... ... ... ... >>> C.__qualname__ \\'C\\' >>> C.D.__qualname__ \\'C.D\\' >>> C.D.meth.__qualname__ \\'C.D.meth\\'\\n\\nclass D:\\n\\ndef meth(self):\\n\\npass\\n\\nWhen used to refer to modules, the fully qualiﬁed name means the entire dotted path to the module, including any parent packages, e.g. email.mime.text:\\n\\n>>> import email.mime.text >>> email.mime.text.__name__ \\'email.mime.text\\'\\n\\nreference count The number of references to an object. When the reference count of an object drops to zero, it is deallocated. Reference counting is generally not visible to Python code, but it is a key element of the CPython implementation. The sys module deﬁnes a getrefcount() function that programmers can call to return the reference count for a particular object.\\n\\nregular package A traditional package, such as a directory containing an __init__.py ﬁle.\\n\\nSee also namespace package.\\n\\n__slots__ A declaration inside a class that saves memory by pre-declaring space for instance attributes and eliminating instance dictionaries. Though popular, the technique is somewhat tricky to get right and is best reserved for rare cases where there are large numbers of instances in a memory-critical application.\\n\\nsequence An iterable which supports eﬃcient element access using integer indices via the __getitem__() special method and deﬁnes a __len__() method that returns the length of the sequence. Some built-in sequence types are list, str, tuple, and bytes. Note that dict also supports __getitem__() and __len__(), but is considered a mapping rather than a sequence because the lookups use arbitrary immutable keys rather than integers.\\n\\nThe collections.abc.Sequence abstract base class deﬁnes a much richer interface that goes beyond just __getitem__() and __len__(), adding count(), index(), __contains__(), and __reversed__(). Types that implement this expanded interface can be registered explicitly using register().\\n\\nsingle dispatch A form of generic function dispatch where the implementation is chosen based on the type\\n\\nof a single argument.\\n\\nslice An object usually containing a portion of a sequence. A slice is created using the subscript notation, [] with colons between numbers when several are given, such as in variable_name[1:3:5]. The bracket (subscript) notation uses slice objects internally.\\n\\n123\\n\\nPython Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n\\nspecial method A method that is called implicitly by Python to execute a certain operation on a type, such as addition. Such methods have names starting and ending with double underscores. Special methods are documented in specialnames.\\n\\nstatement A statement is part of a suite (a “block” of code). A statement is either an expression or one of\\n\\nseveral constructs with a keyword, such as if, while or for.\\n\\nstruct sequence A tuple with named elements. Struct sequences expose an interface similar to named tuple in that elements can either be accessed either by index or as an attribute. However, they do not have any of the named tuple methods like _make() or _asdict(). Examples of struct sequences include sys.float_info and the return value of os.stat().\\n\\ntext encoding A codec which encodes Unicode strings to bytes.\\n\\ntext ﬁle A ﬁle object able to read and write str objects. Often, a text ﬁle actually accesses a byte-oriented datastream and handles the text encoding automatically. Examples of text ﬁles are ﬁles opened in text mode (\\'r\\' or \\'w\\'), sys.stdin, sys.stdout, and instances of io.StringIO.\\n\\nSee also binary ﬁle for a ﬁle object able to read and write bytes-like objects.\\n\\ntriple-quoted string A string which is bound by three instances of either a quotation mark (“) or an apostrophe (‘). While they don’t provide any functionality not available with single-quoted strings, they are useful for a number of reasons. They allow you to include unescaped single and double quotes within a string and they can span multiple lines without the use of the continuation character, making them especially useful when writing docstrings.\\n\\ntype The type of a Python object determines what kind of object it is; every object has a type. An object’s\\n\\ntype is accessible as its __class__ attribute or can be retrieved with type(obj).\\n\\ntype alias A synonym for a type, created by assigning the type to an identiﬁer.\\n\\nType aliases are useful for simplifying type hints. For example:\\n\\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\\n\\ndef remove_gray_shades(\\n\\ncolors: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:\\n\\npass\\n\\ncould be made more readable like this:\\n\\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\\n\\nColor = Tuple[int, int, int]\\n\\ndef remove_gray_shades(colors: List[Color]) -> List[Color]:\\n\\npass\\n\\nSee typing and PEP 484, which describe this functionality.\\n\\ntype hint An annotation that speciﬁes the expected type for a variable, a class attribute, or a function\\n\\nparameter or return value.\\n\\nType hints are optional and are not enforced by Python but they are useful to static type analysis tools, and aid IDEs with code completion and refactoring.\\n\\nType hints of global variables, class attributes, and functions, but not local variables, can be accessed using typing.get_type_hints().\\n\\nSee typing and PEP 484, which describe this functionality.\\n\\nuniversal newlines A manner of interpreting text streams in which all of the following are recognized as ending a line: the Unix end-of-line convention \\'\\\\n\\', the Windows convention \\'\\\\r\\\\n\\', and the old\\n\\n124\\n\\nAppendix A.

It is also a handy desk calculator.\\n\\nPython enables programs to be written compactly and readably.

Because of its more general data types Python is applicable to a much larger problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least as easy in Python as in those languages.\\n\\nPython allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs.

       "'In Python, a function is a series of statements that returns some value to a caller. It can also be passed zero or more arguments which may be used in the execution of the body. Functions are a fundamental concept in programming and are used to organize and reuse code.\\n\\nA function typically has the following characteristics:\\n\\n1. It has a name, which is used to call the function.\\n2. It takes zero or more arguments, which are passed to the function when it is called.\\n3. It has a body, which is the series of statements that are executed when the function is called.\\n4. It returns a value, which is the result of the function\\'s execution.\\n\\nFunctions can be used to perform a variety of tasks, such as:\\n\\n* Calculating a value based on input arguments\\n* Performing a specific operation on a set of data\\n* Returning a value based on a set of conditions\\n* Organizing and reusing code\\n\\nFunctions can be defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and a list of arguments in parentheses. The body of the function is indented and contains the statements that are executed when the function is called.\\n\\nHere is an example of a simple function:\\n```python\\ndef greet(name):\\n    print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\\n\\ngreet(\"John\")  # Output: Hello, John!\\n```\\nIn this example, the `greet` function takes a single argument `name` and prints a greeting message to the console. When the function is called with the argument `\"John\"`, it prints the message \"Hello, John!\".'"
